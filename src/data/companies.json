At its core, HRT is a small tech company with a big impact.\nCollaboration\nCollaboration sets HRT apart within our industry. We count among us many brilliant minds, but we’ve learned that the best ideas are born in a shared research and development environment.\nCode of Ethics\nOur internal code of ethics far exceeds the expectations of the regulatory environment in which we operate. We are conscientious market participants advocating for fair and transparent markets for everyone. This philosophy influences every aspect of our research.\nDiversity & Inclusion\nAt HRT, we celebrate Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging. Our culture is a reflection of the individuals – across race, gender identity and expression, age, religion and worship practices, education status, nationality, and identity – who bring their varied perspectives to work.\nMake it Better\nBoth as individuals and as a company we are tenacious. We are insatiable innovators looking to improve every aspect of our business. We don’t settle until we make it better.\nTogetherness\nHRT is a community of friends and colleagues. Whether we are sharing a meal or competing over a game of ping pong, HRT embraces a culture of togetherness that extends far beyond the walls of our office.\nNon-siloed and collaborative culture\nOn-site gym in NYC\nFully stocked kitchen, plus catered meals\nShared meals in our cafeteria\nA culture of togetherness\nA passion for play\nWell-stocked drink fridge\nProfessional development opportunities\nLeaders who code\nOne of the highest private outdoor terraces in NYC\nFamilies welcome\nRegular outings and company trips\nPerks & Benefits\nHealth Coverage\nFamily Support\nMeals & Snacks\nInclusivity & Accessibility\nTogetherness\nTime Off\nFitness\nComfort\nHybrid Work\nProfessional Development\nFinancial Wellbeing\nHealth Coverage\nNothing is more important to us than employee health. At HRT, you can expect company-paid (no premiums!) medical and dental coverage across our global offices. We also offer HRT-funded Health Savings Accounts, uncapped sick days, affordable vision insurance, flexible spending accounts, and Modern Health memberships, which provide access to appointments with therapists and coaches for employees and their dependents at no cost.\nFamily Time\nSupporting our employees also means supporting the people that they love. We offer comprehensive parental leave and family planning benefits to help HRTers prioritize family. US employees can access family planning support through Progyny, including egg freezing, fertility treatments, adoption and surrogacy benefits. Caregiver support, including back-up child care, is available through our partnership with Vivvi. We also host plenty of family-friendly events including kids' day, family nights, and company-wide trips.\nMeals & Snacks\nWe take food very seriously. HRTers enjoy complimentary breakfasts and lunches, along with a wide selection of healthy snacks. Need a caffeine boost? Our coffee bar awaits. And for moments of relaxation, a well-stocked beer and wine fridge.\nInclusive & Accessible Environment\nWe offer gender-affirming health coverage (region-dependent), gender-neutral bathrooms in many of our offices, and support for HRTers who are transitioning at work. Private wellness rooms are available for meditation, prayer, lactation, or as a private space to attend a virtual appointment. We’re always looking for ways to remove barriers and empower employees of all abilities — if there’s a way we can make it easier for individuals to do their best work, we’re here for it.\nTogetherness\nOur social calendar includes regular outings like pottery, painting, pizza making, team dinners/happy hours, and an annual volleyball tournament. We take regular team retreats and company-wide trips to connect with each other (families included!) In-office, you can find us unwinding at the end of a long day with video games, happy hours, snack drops, wine/tea club, poker, or table tennis!\nTime Off\nWe believe recharging is important, and time off is encouraged. Employees receive generous paid vacation along with personal days, market holidays, and company-wide trips.\nFitness\nEnjoy an on-site cardio and weight room in NYC, complete with sweeping views that will make going to the gym even easier. And for those in our other offices, we've got you covered with a fitness reimbursement.\nComfort\nCome as you are! Our dress code is whatever makes you feel comfortable, at ease, and able to do your best work — whether that be your favorite pair of sweatpants or runway best.\nHybrid Work\nWe recognize that different work carries different in-office needs: some teams require round-the-clock coverage or hands-on maintenance, while others operate across different continents and time zones. While the majority of teams adopt a fairly even split between in-office and remote work, many choose to come in every day.\nProfessional Development\nLearning at HRT never stops. We offer employees reimbursement for career development courses, in-house professional learning & development opportunities, and a vibrant intellectual culture that presents daily opportunities to learn something new.\nFinancial Wellbeing\nIn addition to competitive compensation, we offer generous 401k matching to all full-time US employees, pension matching in our EU locations, and CPF contributions for employees in Singapore.

Relocation assistance is available to support your move.\nOur Offices\nWith offices from New York to Singapore, our reach extends to more than 200 markets worldwide.

Our global community spans a wide variety of disciplines and backgrounds, with a mutual commitment to curiosity and the pursuit of innovation that drives our collective success.\nExplore Job Openings\nCultural SPOTLIGHT\nVideo\nHRT Shorts: What’s it like working at our London office?\nWatch Now →\nTech Blog\nHow HRT Approached Remote Work During the Pandemic\nBy LB Manzolillo & Bill Vanderson\nTech Blog\nThe Communication Habits That Help HRT’s Engineering Teams Thrive\nBy Taylor Legg\nCore Values\nAutomation & Efficiency\nWe are disciples of automation and efficiency, trading millions of times a day in markets around the globe. At its core, HRT is a small tech company with a big impact.\nCollaboration\nCollaboration sets HRT apart within our industry. We count among us many brilliant minds, but we’ve learned that the best ideas are born in a shared research and development environment.\nCode of Ethics\nOur internal code of ethics far exceeds the expectations of the regulatory environment in which we operate. We are conscientious market participants advocating for fair and transparent markets for everyone. This philosophy influences every aspect of our research.\nDiversity & Inclusion\nAt HRT, we celebrate Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging. Our culture is a reflection of the individuals – across race, gender identity and expression, age, religion and worship practices, education status, nationality, and identity – who bring their varied perspectives to work.\nMake it Better\nBoth as individuals and as a company we are tenacious. We are insatiable innovators looking to improve every aspect of our business. We don’t settle until we make it better.\nTogetherness\nHRT is a community of friends and colleagues. Whether we are sharing a meal or competing over a game of ping pong, HRT embraces a culture of togetherness that extends far beyond the walls of our office.\nNon-siloed and collaborative culture\nOn-site gym in NYC\nFully stocked kitchen, plus catered meals\nShared meals in our cafeteria\nA culture of togetherness\nA passion for play\nWell-stocked drink fridge\nProfessional development opportunities\nLeaders who code\nOne of the highest private outdoor terraces in NYC\nFamilies welcome\nRegular outings and company trips\nPerks & Benefits\nHealth Coverage\nFamily Support\nMeals & Snacks\nInclusivity & Accessibility\nTogetherness\nTime Off\nFitness\nComfort\nHybrid Work\nProfessional Development\nFinancial Wellbeing\nHealth Coverage\nNothing is more important to us than employee health. At HRT, you can expect company-paid (no premiums!) medical and dental coverage across our global offices. We also offer HRT-funded Health Savings Accounts, uncapped sick days, affordable vision insurance, flexible spending accounts, and Modern Health memberships, which provide access to appointments with therapists and coaches for employees and their dependents at no cost.\nFamily Time\nSupporting our employees also means supporting the people that they love. We offer comprehensive parental leave and family planning benefits to help HRTers prioritize family. US employees can access family planning support through Progyny, including egg freezing, fertility treatments, adoption and surrogacy benefits. Caregiver support, including back-up child care, is available through our partnership with Vivvi. We also host plenty of family-friendly events including kids' day, family nights, and company-wide trips.\nMeals & Snacks\nWe take food very seriously. HRTers enjoy complimentary breakfasts and lunches, along with a wide selection of healthy snacks. Need a caffeine boost? Our coffee bar awaits. And for moments of relaxation, a well-stocked beer and wine fridge.\nInclusive & Accessible Environment\nWe offer gender-affirming health coverage (region-dependent), gender-neutral bathrooms in many of our offices, and support for HRTers who are transitioning at work. Private wellness rooms are available for meditation, prayer, lactation, or as a private space to attend a virtual appointment. We’re always looking for ways to remove barriers and empower employees of all abilities — if there’s a way we can make it easier for individuals to do their best work, we’re here for it.\nTogetherness\nOur social calendar includes regular outings like pottery, painting, pizza making, team dinners/happy hours, and an annual volleyball tournament. We take regular team retreats and company-wide trips to connect with each other (families included!) In-office, you can find us unwinding at the end of a long day with video games, happy hours, snack drops, wine/tea club, poker, or table tennis!\nTime Off\nWe believe recharging is important, and time off is encouraged. Employees receive generous paid vacation along with personal days, market holidays, and company-wide trips.\nFitness\nEnjoy an on-site cardio and weight room in NYC, complete with sweeping views that will make going to the gym even easier. And for those in our other offices, we've got you covered with a fitness reimbursement.\nComfort\nCome as you are! Our dress code is whatever makes you feel comfortable, at ease, and able to do your best work — whether that be your favorite pair of sweatpants or runway best.\nHybrid Work\nWe recognize that different work carries different in-office needs: some teams require round-the-clock coverage or hands-on maintenance, while others operate across different continents and time zones. While the majority of teams adopt a fairly even split between in-office and remote work, many choose to come in every day.\nProfessional Development\nLearning at HRT never stops. We offer employees reimbursement for career development courses, in-house professional learning & development opportunities, and a vibrant intellectual culture that presents daily opportunities to learn something new.\nFinancial Wellbeing\nIn addition to competitive compensation, we offer generous 401k matching to all full-time US employees, pension matching in our EU locations, and CPF contributions for employees in Singapore. Moving to a new city to start your career at HRT? Relocation assistance is available to support your move.\nOur Offices\nWith offices from New York to Singapore, our reach extends to more than 200 markets worldwide. With a strong presence in six countries, our global teams enable us to trade thousands of financial products quickly and efficiently.\nLearn More\nDiversity, Equity,Inclusion & Belonging\nWe strive to build a diverse workplace where all HRTers feel welcomed and empowered to do their best work and build the future of trading — together.\nLearn More"

My name is Kasha. My name's Sophie. My name's Ben. All of the interns are supervised by a mentor who's a full-time quant researcher. On the day to day, we're doing a lot of coding, we're reading a lot of papers, we're trying to come up with some new maths, trying to bring it all together to solve an interesting problem. I'm intern in data science. Uh, the project I've been working on focus both on data analysis and inventing some strategies for trying to merge multiple time series into one. So my main focus, this internship, has been on developing visualization tools for various types of, uh, data sets that we currently process within the Team. My internship was in security operations. So my role day-to-day was to provide support for different security functions across the company. Originally I was working in the infrastructure function. I was in the compute infrastructure engineering team, managing, monitoring, and maintaining the hardware infrastructure at G Research. So the most attractive thing to me was the culture. Everyone who I knew who worked here had said that it was, you know, a group of incredibly smart people doing super smart things in a very supportive environment. It feels like a fusion between academia and tech industry. Uh, and I absolutely love it. But definitely the um, pace is much faster. You are placed within a team. Uh, at G-Research. You have people to constantly bounce your ideas off and iterate on your work. Ultimately, you get a lot of other people's input and knowledge. It gives you that sort of introduction to industry before actually graduating. I've never had to worry about asking silly questions or feeling judged. Anyone that I've reached out for help with has just been excellent. At university, it's very guided, whereas at G-Research you've got the opportunity to expand what you know and also sort of really follow what you are doing at university on with a real world application. There's a big focus on also helping you develop how you want to developing your interests. I wanted some experience in the sort of software world, um, and doing research gave me the opportunity to sort of see where I wanted to go. I've been exposed to a huge number of really talented people, um, whether that be fellow interns or colleagues who already work at your research. Uh, we have team socials and these are really nice opportunities to meet other people on the internship, but also to meet other people you might deal with day to day. I got offered a graduate role at the end of my internship. That was a really nice thing to know that I had whilst working through my final year of university.\nOpen video transcript\nInternship assessment processes\nInterested in joining one of our internships or placement year programmes?

This is irrespective of gender, race, religion, sexuality or any other characteristic.\nThe statistics reflect that the best paying roles in our business require undergraduate and in many cases postgraduate study in maths, computer science, the physical sciences and technology. Men account for roughly three times as many graduates* in these subjects as women and have done for many years and so not surprisingly, men hold more of the best paying roles in our business. We believe this gender imbalance is a missed opportunity for the industry and we welcome applications from smart, qualified women who are interested in what we do.\n*Source HESA enrolment data for academic years 2021/2022: Personal characteristics – HE students by CAH level 1 and sex.

The primary objective of G-Research’s tax strategy is accurate and timely tax compliance. This includes the following:\nTo ensure local and international laws and regulations are complied with, and that OECD guidance is followed;\nTo ensure that all taxes, including corporation tax, employer taxes, employee withholding taxes, indirect taxes and other local taxes are paid in full and in a timely manner;\nTo provide training and guidance on tax matters to the business as required; and\nTo maintain a relationship with HMRC based on foundations of compliance and transparent communication.\nApproach to Risk Management and Governance Arrangements in Relation to UK Taxation\nResponsibility for G-Research’s tax contribution, tax risk, and governance sits with the respective entities’ governing bodies, which provide oversight and strategic direction. Day-to-day responsibility is delegated to the Head of Finance and the Head of Tax, supported by the wider Finance team.\nG-Research’s tax compliance function is managed by its team of in-house qualified accountants, ensuring that tax decisions are informed and current. A control framework is in place to ensure that tax risks, including changes to relevant laws, regulations and guidance, are identified in a timely manner and subsequent action is taken to mitigate those risks to an acceptably low level. Tax risks and responses are documented to ensure that G-Research’s tax strategy remains transparent, and to ensure that it is communicated to and recognised by those in charge of governance.\nAttitude Towards Tax Planning and Risk\nG-Research does not consider tax planning to be a major driver in determining business strategy and key decision making. G-Research has a low-risk appetite in terms of tax planning opportunities.\nWe may utilise available tax reliefs and incentives where appropriate and in a manner which is consistent with the applicable law.\nTax advice will be sought from external advisors in respect of material transactions or when the Finance team do not have the necessary expertise required in a particular area. Significant transactions within, or changes to, the business are reviewed and approved by the governing bodies of the relevant entities.\nOur Approach to Working With HMRC\nG-Research looks to maintain an open, positive and cooperative working relationship with HMRC.\nWe are committed to working with HMRC to resolve any issues that arise and to providing appropriate disclosure of relevant facts to enable the progression of HMRC enquiries.\nThis strategy statement has been prepared in accordance with paragraphs 19(2) and 25 of Schedule 19 of the Finance Act 2016 and provides an overview of G-Research’s policy and approach to its tax affairs for the financial period ended 31 March 2025. This strategy was published on 27 March 2025.\nThis statement is made on behalf of Alastair LLP in respect of the financial period ending 31 March\n2025 and has been duly approved.\nThis is our slavery and human trafficking statement for the purposes of section 54(1) of the Modern\nSlavery Act 2015.\nWe endeavour to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or\nbusiness.\nWe provide corporate support services (including, but not limited to, human resources, legal,\nfinance, operational risk management and premises). We also provide staff to certain related\nentities. We consider the risk of slavery or human trafficking within our supply chain to be low since\nwe have straightforward supply chains compared with other sectors in the UK, and the majority of\nthe service providers we use are based in the UK. We will not knowingly do business with any\nsuppliers who are involved in slavery. As we do not have intricate or complex supply chains, no\nfurther action with regards to slavery or human trafficking has been deemed necessary at this time.\nOur recruitment processes are reviewed regularly. We have robust procedures in place for the\nvetting of new staff. We ensure that we are able to confirm their identities and that they are paid\ndirectly into a personal bank account. We confirm that staff have the right to work in the UK and are\naware of their rights and responsibilities associated with working in the UK. We have policies and\nprocedures in place to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. All staff are properly remunerated\nat a level above the UK’s national living wage.\nApproved and signed by the LLP Designated Members of Alastair LLP\n\n========================================\nPAGE: OUR COMMUNITY\nURL: https://www.gresearch.com/about/our-community/\n========================================\n\nOur community\nWe partner with a number of charities, chosen by our people, to make a positive impact on our local communities.\nVolunteering\nWe boast an incredible array of world-class skills across our business.

My name is Kasha. My name's Sophie. My name's Ben. All of the interns are supervised by a mentor who's a full-time quant researcher. On the day to day, we're doing a lot of coding, we're reading a lot of papers, we're trying to come up with some new maths, trying to bring it all together to solve an interesting problem. I'm intern in data science. Uh, the project I've been working on focus both on data analysis and inventing some strategies for trying to merge multiple time series into one. So my main focus, this internship, has been on developing visualization tools for various types of, uh, data sets that we currently process within the Team. My internship was in security operations. So my role day-to-day was to provide support for different security functions across the company. Originally I was working in the infrastructure function. I was in the compute infrastructure engineering team, managing, monitoring, and maintaining the hardware infrastructure at G Research. So the most attractive thing to me was the culture. Everyone who I knew who worked here had said that it was, you know, a group of incredibly smart people doing super smart things in a very supportive environment. It feels like a fusion between academia and tech industry. Uh, and I absolutely love it. But definitely the um, pace is much faster. You are placed within a team. Uh, at G-Research. You have people to constantly bounce your ideas off and iterate on your work. Ultimately, you get a lot of other people's input and knowledge. It gives you that sort of introduction to industry before actually graduating. I've never had to worry about asking silly questions or feeling judged. Anyone that I've reached out for help with has just been excellent. At university, it's very guided, whereas at G-Research you've got the opportunity to expand what you know and also sort of really follow what you are doing at university on with a real world application. There's a big focus on also helping you develop how you want to developing your interests. I wanted some experience in the sort of software world, um, and doing research gave me the opportunity to sort of see where I wanted to go. I've been exposed to a huge number of really talented people, um, whether that be fellow interns or colleagues who already work at your research. Uh, we have team socials and these are really nice opportunities to meet other people on the internship, but also to meet other people you might deal with day to day. I got offered a graduate role at the end of my internship. That was a really nice thing to know that I had whilst working through my final year of university.\nOpen video transcript\nInternship assessment processes\nInterested in joining one of our internships or placement year programmes?

This is irrespective of gender, race, religion, sexuality or any other characteristic.\nThe statistics reflect that the best paying roles in our business require undergraduate and in many cases postgraduate study in maths, computer science, the physical sciences and technology. Men account for roughly three times as many graduates* in these subjects as women and have done for many years and so not surprisingly, men hold more of the best paying roles in our business. We believe this gender imbalance is a missed opportunity for the industry and we welcome applications from smart, qualified women who are interested in what we do.\n*Source HESA enrolment data for academic years 2021/2022: Personal characteristics – HE students by CAH level 1 and sex. Assumes gender ratio for graduates is in line with admissions.\nGender Pay Statistics for 5 April 2023:\nGender pay Gap:\nMean: 50%\nMedian: 46%\nGender Bonus Gap:\nMean: 65%\nMedian: 58%\nProportion of employees receiving a bonus:\nMale: 96%\nFemale: 91%\nProportion of employees in each pay quartile:\nLower – Male: 63% , Female: 37%\nLower Middle – Male: 84% , Female: 16%\nUpper Middle – Male: 91% , Female: 9%\nUpper– Male: 95%, Female: 5%\nIntroduction\nThe G-Research group is committed to being a responsible taxpayer, complying with local tax laws and regulations and with OECD guidance. The primary objective of G-Research’s tax strategy is accurate and timely tax compliance. This includes the following:\nTo ensure local and international laws and regulations are complied with, and that OECD guidance is followed;\nTo ensure that all taxes, including corporation tax, employer taxes, employee withholding taxes, indirect taxes and other local taxes are paid in full and in a timely manner;\nTo provide training and guidance on tax matters to the business as required; and\nTo maintain a relationship with HMRC based on foundations of compliance and transparent communication.\nApproach to Risk Management and Governance Arrangements in Relation to UK Taxation\nResponsibility for G-Research’s tax contribution, tax risk, and governance sits with the respective entities’ governing bodies, which provide oversight and strategic direction. Day-to-day responsibility is delegated to the Head of Finance and the Head of Tax, supported by the wider Finance team.\nG-Research’s tax compliance function is managed by its team of in-house qualified accountants, ensuring that tax decisions are informed and current. A control framework is in place to ensure that tax risks, including changes to relevant laws, regulations and guidance, are identified in a timely manner and subsequent action is taken to mitigate those risks to an acceptably low level. Tax risks and responses are documented to ensure that G-Research’s tax strategy remains transparent, and to ensure that it is communicated to and recognised by those in charge of governance.\nAttitude Towards Tax Planning and Risk\nG-Research does not consider tax planning to be a major driver in determining business strategy and key decision making. G-Research has a low-risk appetite in terms of tax planning opportunities.\nWe may utilise available tax reliefs and incentives where appropriate and in a manner which is consistent with the applicable law.\nTax advice will be sought from external advisors in respect of material transactions or when the Finance team do not have the necessary expertise required in a particular area. Significant transactions within, or changes to, the business are reviewed and approved by the governing bodies of the relevant entities.\nOur Approach to Working With HMRC\nG-Research looks to maintain an open, positive and cooperative working relationship with HMRC.\nWe are committed to working with HMRC to resolve any issues that arise and to providing appropriate disclosure of relevant facts to enable the progression of HMRC enquiries.\nThis strategy statement has been prepared in accordance with paragraphs 19(2) and 25 of Schedule 19 of the Finance Act 2016 and provides an overview of G-Research’s policy and approach to its tax affairs for the financial period ended 31 March 2025. This strategy was published on 27 March 2025.\nThis statement is made on behalf of Alastair LLP in respect of the financial period ending 31 March\n2025 and has been duly approved.\nThis is our slavery and human trafficking statement for the purposes of section 54(1) of the Modern\nSlavery Act 2015.\nWe endeavour to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or\nbusiness.\nWe provide corporate support services (including, but not limited to, human resources, legal,\nfinance, operational risk management and premises). We also provide staff to certain related\nentities. We consider the risk of slavery or human trafficking within our supply chain to be low since\nwe have straightforward supply chains compared with other sectors in the UK, and the majority of\nthe service providers we use are based in the UK. We will not knowingly do business with any\nsuppliers who are involved in slavery. As we do not have intricate or complex supply chains, no\nfurther action with regards to slavery or human trafficking has been deemed necessary at this time.\nOur recruitment processes are reviewed regularly. We have robust procedures in place for the\nvetting of new staff. We ensure that we are able to confirm their identities and that they are paid\ndirectly into a personal bank account. We confirm that staff have the right to work in the UK and are\naware of their rights and responsibilities associated with working in the UK. We have policies and\nprocedures in place to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. All staff are properly remunerated\nat a level above the UK’s national living wage.\nApproved and signed by the LLP Designated Members of Alastair LLP"

One word: Data.\nData science and research are at the very core of Optiver’s pricing strategies. Our teams tackle challenges at the intersection of technology and trading – where some of the most complex and valuable financial market data resides. With world-class skills that cut through the noise, Optiver’s data science and research teams directly contribute to the precision and scalability of our trading business.\ndata science\nFind YourPerfect Fit\nData analytics\nIt all starts with the exchanges, where we monitor a constant stream of trades and prices. All of this information must be collected, processed and relayed to both human traders and automated strategies alike.\nThese data sets present their own complexities, including a typically very low signal-to-noise ratio. Our analysts must combine data science with a solid understanding of data lineage and trading dynamics to cut through the noise. In this way, we can continuously improve trading logics and remain performant even during periods of market turbulence.\nData science\nData scientists at Optiver apply their advanced engineering and machine learning skills to develop and improve our trading strategies. They sit on our trading floor – the beating heart of our business – to share market insights with traders, quantitative researchers and developers. Our data scientists’ observations and recommendations inform crucial trading decisions in real-time, making them trusted and highly-valued colleagues.\nOptiver’s data scientists collaborate with data analysts, data engineers, quantitative researchers and traders. It’s a fascinating role that requires a strong coding background and problem-solving skills.\nMathematical modelling\nOptiver’s researchers develop sophisticated models that take market dynamics into account to consistently price tens of thousands of instruments. These models must be flexible enough to account for the nuances of the market while at the same time remaining sound and robust. By working together with traders and software engineers, our researchers strive to continuously unlock solutions that further strengthen our pricing.\nMachine learning\nMachine learning is heavily utilised at Optiver to predict how markets might perform in the future. Based on these implied findings, data scientists convert immense amounts of historical data into trading signals. The goal is improving our prediction accuracy. To do so, Optiver is constantly looking for innovative ways to derive useful insights from the data.\nInfrastructure & pipeline\nOptiver’s data science activities wouldn’t exist without our state-of-the-art data infrastructure. Our growing team of data engineers is dedicated to building a cutting-edge, big data pipeline to ensure the real-time availability of terabytes of market data. Each year our Amsterdam office alone processes market data in the magnitude of petabytes. With the help of highly skilled data analysts, who combine data processing skills with a thorough understanding of strategies, we make sure the data tells a story.\nQuantitative research\nQuantitative research is the foundation upon which Optiver’s trading activities are built. Our research teams – experts with MSc and PhD degrees in a variety of STEM subjects – utilise a scientific approach to research and design our world-class trading algorithms. This means applying and developing state-of-the-art stochastic models to price options and predict market volatility, as well as utilising Monte Carlo methods to determine how to perform differentiation on discrete realisations of stochastic processes. Our researchers develop statistical arbitrage strategies by working with petabytes of low latency, high-frequency market data sets, an extensive high-powered computing back-testing framework and much more.\nOptiver’s researchers, steeped in academic methods, invite their teammates and traders to challenge each hypothesis. Can it be mathematically improved? Does it pose a potential risk? Does it exploit a market behavioural pattern? Can it sustain its output goals? Constant testing, analysis, refinement and innovation ensure our quantitative models remain at the cutting-edge of capital markets.\nLearn more\nsubheader\nAshley – Amsterdam\n“The industry itself is ever-evolving and becoming a bigger part of modern society’s development.

They manage broker relationships, interpret voice-brokered market flow and use these real-time insights to inform their trading decisions. It’s a role built around a unique blend of strong communication, sharp market intuition and quantitative thinking. But how these skills combine depends entirely on the desk.\nOn S&P, traders rely heavily on speed, decisiveness and execution. On Single Stock Options, negotiation, timing and long-term relationship building hold more weight.\nThat’s why you’ll find traders who started their careers in sales, consulting and technology sitting alongside former asset managers and brokers. Diverse backgrounds, different strengths, each matched to the desk where they’ll best fit.\nTo show this in practice, five Institutional Traders from our London and Amsterdam team share how their career experiences helped them succeed in a role few expected, along with practical advice for anyone considering a similar path.\nMeet the team\nMaarten | Index\nFinance and Economics graduate with a background in asset management sales.\nSophie | Single Stock Options\nEconomics graduate who spent a year on Amazon’s Business Graduate Scheme.\nMartin | S&P\nBusiness Administration graduate who started in commercial real estate.\nPatrick | Commodities\nExperienced volatility trader with a decade spent across leading market-making firms.\nFerdinand | Single Stock Options\nFormer broker with 14 years’ experience across Amsterdam, Geneva and Hong Kong.\nExplore the article\nPart 1: How five team members found their fit\nThere’s no “right” background for an Institutional Trader at Optiver. Some joined from brokerage or market making, others from sales, asset management or entirely different industries. Most didn’t even know this role existed. So how did they end up here—and how did they know they’d be a fit?\nWhat was your path into Institutional Trading?\nSophie: I had pretty much zero financial background beyond a few modules during my Economics degree. After university, I spent a year at Amazon speaking to a lot of clients and helping sellers grow their businesses. It gave me a good foundation for relationship management, so I wanted to apply that somewhere more analytical and fast-paced.\nFerdinand: I started as a broker on the live trading floor when I was 19. I planned to try it before university and loved it so much I never went back. Over my career, I regularly interacted with Optiver as a client. So when I returned to Amsterdam they reached out to see if I’d be interested in Institutional Trading. For me, it was a great opportunity to see it from the other side.\nMaarten: I worked at an investment bank where most of my time was spent reading about markets and advising institutional investors. In asset management sales, I found myself talking about what was happening but not steering anything. I wanted something more varied where I could apply my financial knowledge and actually influence outcomes. I found that in this seat.\nPatrick: This is my third market-making firm over a 10-year career. My first experience taught me core market-making principles across multiple products on the floor, which is definitely beneficial as a young trader. I then moved to a role where I could integrate my product knowledge and broker relationships in a more technical environment with an execution focus.Institutional Trading felt like the natural step to take all that experience to the next level: becoming a more intelligent volatility trader, taking larger positions and feeling integral to the market I’m trading.\nMartin: After graduating, I worked in commercial real estate. Different from trading but it gave me a solid grounding in market fundamentals, professionalism and relationship building, skills that transferred surprisingly well when I learned about the role.\nWhy did this opportunity stand out to you, given your background and interests?\nSophie: I hadn’t come across many jobs that require such a blend of technical and people skills. Most roles lean heavily one way or the other. I’ve always been more of an all-rounder and I wanted something more technical than pure sales, but not something purely quantitative either. That middle ground is rare to find.\nMaarten: I knew Optiver by name but didn’t know this role existed. I thought all traders here had very quant heavy backgrounds. I like working in a quantitative capacity, but I wouldn’t describe myself as a quant.The sales and relationships management skills from my previous role apply well to brokers and counterparties you speak to daily here. You have to combine all the different aspects, thinking on your feet, communicating effectively, collaborating well and you have to have some theoretical understanding of what goes into a quote. That combination of the analytical side of trading with that human aspect was exciting.\nMartin: When I first saw the role, I didn’t have a clear picture of what an Institutional Trader actually did. What appealed to me during the interviews was the internal versus external communication aspect, being the voice to the market while also working with the trading desk in real time. I’m quite sociable. I like working with people more than just staring at screens and code.\nFerdinand: I wanted to challenge myself to grow and compete on a different level. Compared to the brokerage industry, the environment here changes every day. It was the opportunity to grow within the firm and to have impact at the desk level and the firm level depending on the market you’re looking at. I love the game-like element of the role. It’s a combination of chess and poker, thinking a few steps ahead while reading the person on the other side of the phone.\n“I hadn’t come across many jobs that require such a blend of technical and people skills. Most roles lean heavily one way or the other. That middle ground is rare to find.”— Sophie\nPart 2: Learning at the desk\nOnce in the role, every trader faces a learning curve. Success depends not just on how quickly they can adapt, but how well they use their existing strengths to make an impact on the trading floor. We asked the team what it was like to join their desk, and what makes it different from other traditional trading roles.\nWhat do you enjoy most about your day-to-day work?\nFerdinand: Three things. First, the focus on development and education. I wish I’d had a mentor or training programme like what we provide when I was starting out. The training is both theoretical and mental and gives you the tools to handle the high-pressure environment. You receive almost constant feedback from your team and from counterparties. As a mentor, I get to guide people through that.Second, competing with the rest of the world. We compare ourselves to top athletes and it’s easy to forget how much work goes into performing at that level. Looking back and seeing how far you’ve come and the impact you’re having on the trading floor is the best feeling you can have.Finally, it’s the relationships we build. It’s very competitive and the people we talk to are also the best in their markets. We build such a high level of trust that even if one side makes a mistake, it doesn’t get personal. We know both sides are there for the long term and that we’ll still need each other for the next 20 trades that day or the next 10,000 trades in my career.\nMaarten: That’s easy, the trading part. That’s what we do on a daily basis and in times of volatility, it really shows our value add as a market maker to improve liquidity. It’s the most challenging time as you have to prioritise well, take on more risk, communicate well and make split-second decisions.The energy on the floor is something you can feel the moment you step in.\nPatrick: Being a market maker specifically, every single day is effectively a new problem. You can apply past experience to what’s currently happening in the market but when you walk in, you really don’t know what’s going to happen that day. There’s immediate feedback too, from PnL, your peers, your desk. You can tell immediately if you’re trading well and if not, you can change things quickly to trade better.\nMartin: When I look back, I can see how much I’ve grown and improved while doing the job. Business trips are a good example. Initially, they were solely focused on meeting people and engaging with them. Over time, they evolved into building deeper connections and strengthening long-term relationships. Now, my trips are centred around understanding the markets and identifying new business opportunities through my network. I trade every day but it’s a continuous evolution.\n“Every single day is effectively a new problem. You can apply past experience to what’s currently happening in the market but when you walk in, you really don’t know what’s going to happen that day.” — Patrick\nWhat’s been your biggest learning since joining the team?\nMartin: A quote that stuck with me is “get everything up to par.” Know the competencies you need for the job, get them to a functional level, then focus on what you’re good at. I knew my mathematical skills were behind, so I invested time there. I didn’t need to be the strongest at options theory but I needed to be strong enough so I could lean into my communication strengths. Working on competencies is an ongoing process. Even after all these years, I still see areas where I can improve. Challenging others and being challenged in return is how we grow and get better together.\nFerdinand: For me, it’s the mindset shift. I had a very different background from most of the team, so I had no idea if I would be successful or not. But you realise that with the right mentality you can keep learning, growing and developing at a high level whatever career stage you’re in. It’s like being a footballer. You don’t need to be a superstar in your first game, but you can get there with effort and belief in yourself.I knew my strength was in relationships, so I focused on catching up on the more technical side, formulas, automation, everything that was further from my background.\nMaarten: You’re never done learning. The job description sounds straightforward, represent Optiver’s quotes, execute in the market. The reality is there are so many different markets and products, each with their own nuances. Every situation requires a different approach.Every day brings new challenges, from market moves to competitive pressure to counterparty interactions. It’s a role that keeps you alert, engaged and always on your toes.\nPatrick: Being more comfortable with more calculated risk. We spend a lot of time developing trading plans and discussing how we would want to react should certain situations happen in the market, expected or unexpected. This allows us to be confident in our volatility calculations so we can react confidently to capitalise on those markets. I’m more proactive with my trading here and we’re much more of an active market participant.\nWhat sets Institutional Trading apart from other trading roles you’ve experienced?\nPatrick: Institutional Traders and Quant Traders work on products together, so there’s a significant uptick in teamwork, sharing trading decisions and bouncing ideas off each other in real time. At other firms, there’s often a greater focus on execution or PnL specifically tied to voice flow. Here, you’re positioned at the frontline of external markets, translating critical market insights directly back to the team. Even on a busy desk, your insights hold real weight.\nMaarten: The impact we have is more noticeable at Optiver because of how flat and how collaborative the environment is. It doesn’t really matter which role you start in, there are so many opportunities to add value. If you spot a market opportunity or a better way for the team to work, you can discuss this directly with the team and create the buy-in needed to move forward and chase the opportunity.\nPart 3: Key skills and advice from the team\nWhile no two desks are the same, certain skills show up across the board. Here, the team shares what they believe makes a great Institutional Trader, and finally, what advice they’d give to someone considering this path.\nIn your experience, what are the most important skills to succeed as an IT?\nFerdinand: Reasoning speed is crucial. You operate in a fast-paced environment where you need to digest and filter information quickly and build a game plan from it. It’s about connecting your competencies—relationship management, negotiation, communication and trading knowledge—and maximising the outcome that comes from combining all of them effectively.\nMaarten: It’s a combination of skills. It’s important to be strong on the relationship side, as we speak to brokers and direct counterparties every day. You need to communicate effectively both internally and externally while also having a solid analytical foundation to understand the trading decisions.\nSophie: The ability to read between the lines is really important. You need to apply common sense and context to critically assess what someone is saying versus what they actually mean which comes with time and practice. You also have to be able to work well under pressure. Sometimes my heart rate spikes, but the adrenaline in those moments makes it fun and the decisions you make under those conditions can have a big impact on PnL.\nPatrick: Strong attention to detail and the ability to multitask are essential. Be effective with the words you use and how you interact with externals, internals and with the systems you work with. You must be able to learn from both your mistakes and your wins. You also have to be a good ambassador for Optiver. In the Institutional Trading role, you interact with external counterparties every day and each interaction leaves them with an impression of the company based on how you present yourself.\n“There is no single definition of a strong Institutional Trader. Not everyone on the team has the same strengths or weaknesses, and different markets value different things. Don’t try to copy someone else, focus on being the best version of yourself.”— Martin\nAny tips or insights you’d share with someone exploring a role like this?\nMartin: Be open, reflective and above all, proactive. You are in the driver’s seat of your career at Optiver. We ensure the right training and coaching are available, but ultimately, you are the one who has to put in the work. Use the smart people around you to steepen your learning curve. There is no single definition of a strong Institutional Trader. Not everyone on the team has the same strengths or weaknesses and different markets value different things. Don’t try to copy someone else, focus on being the best version of yourself.\nFerdinand: It is addictive to compete with the best in the world. Embrace the pressure of a fast and dynamic environment, you know you will perform when the market is moving. We want people to reach a point where they enjoy the game because they know they have mastered the right skills and can apply them confidently in their day-to-day work.\nPatrick: Ask as many questions as you can and realise that there is a takeaway from every trading moment, whether it’s good or bad. Being highly curious is one of the most important drivers of success in this role. You can’t be passive or sit back waiting for others to teach you. If something doesn’t make sense, be intellectually curious enough to research it yourself, understand whether it’s relevant to how you trade and then speak to the people who can explain it. If you don’t understand something, the worst thing you can do is ignore it.\nSophie: Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that held me back in the beginning. I didn’t want to say something that sounded stupid. But if you don’t ask, you won’t grow. Lastly, I’d say have fun and enjoy the ride. It’s an incredibly interesting environment where you’re on top of the markets all day and can really feel the buzz when things get busy.\nEvery Institutional Trader brings something different to the team, and there’s no single background that defines success.

Through lectures, workshops, and hands-on projects, students explore how these areas come together to solve complex problems. For some, this program isn’t just a crash course in options theory, modeling, and problem-solving—it’s the first step toward a summer internship. After five days of learning, top-performers may be invited to return as interns.\nTwo participants from our Chicago Quants program did exactly that. Here’s how they describe the shift from FutureFocus to a quant trading internship.\nAlan\nMajor: Mathematics and Computer Science\nUniversity: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nEthan\nMajor: Mathematics and Physics\nUniversity: New York University\nHow did your experience in FutureFocus prepare you for your internship?\nAlan: We covered a ton of ground in just five days, especially with options theory. That quick deep dive made the possibility of an internship even more exciting because we’d go more in depth on the concepts that were hard to fully grasp with just online resources. The trading games and coding project also gave me a head start because they made similar activities during the internship feel more familiar.\nEthan: It gave me a good sense of what to expect. I was already familiar with how Optiver operates, which made it easier to jump into new challenges during the internship.\nWhat’s been your favorite part of the internship?\nAlan: I enjoy how collaborative it is.

Experiments run today to become tomorrow’s models, signals, risk checks, and position limits. End-to-end research turnaround time should be a core operating target for any desk aiming to compete. The research cycle is simple to state: form a hypothesis, run experiments, evaluate results, then either refine the hypothesis or translate the results into production decisions. The hard part is running this cycle repeatably across thousands of instruments and decades of market data. Here’s how we approach this problem and the engineering choices that made a difference.\nWhat a Research Platform Must Optimize\nWe keep one goal in front of everything else: shorten the loop from idea to validated result. Cost, capacity, capability, and correctness all serve that goal.\nCost: HPC is expensive, so efficiency matters. If you can run twice the compute per dollar, that’s a real competitive edge.\nCapacity: Have enough headroom to avoid blocking the business while keeping usage high. Wasting budget is not an option, and neither is throttling research.\nCapability: A good research platform anticipates the direction of the business and what it needs to allow growth and success not just today but 12 to 24 months from now.\nCorrectness: Reproducibility and traceability are nonnegotiable. If results can’t be recreated, you’re burning cycles, not doing research.\nWhen Pipelines Scale Up\nOn paper, a research pipeline looks linear: generate features, train models, run simulations. Reality bends it out of shape. If feature generation for a single market day takes one hour, about 1,000 trading days will take roughly six weeks of end-to-end runtime. Shard feature generation by day and the runtime drops back down to about an hour, although total computational time stays the same. Now, attempt to generate features for 100 instruments, and you will soon be looking at 100,000+ feature generation jobs. Serialized, the original six weeks turned into roughly 11 years of runtime by changing just one requirement. Parallelism stops being a choice.\nResearchers tend to think about pipelines as mostly linear flows. Once parallelism becomes mandatory, that mental model breaks down. It becomes hard to reason how the underlying computational graph should be structured for maximum throughput and utilization. Without careful shaping, a pipeline that looks simple on a whiteboard can create sharp hotspots in its resource usage. Layer on other dimensions such as team headcount, model and simulation complexity, and you are quickly dealing with a combinatorial explosion that is impossible to optimize by hand.\nA small fraction of a computational graph. The fan-out and convergence patterns already make it hard to reason about by hand, and forcing researchers to operate at this level leads to bottlenecks and wasted compute. The platform is designed to handle that complexity for them.\nThat combinatorial explosion doesn’t just make graphs hard to reason about; it also slams into hard capacity limits quickly. Before we simplify how researchers express pipelines, we need to make sure there is enough compute to run them.\nAddressing Compute Capacity\nIn practice, there are three ways to scale compute capacity: go all-in on on-prem, run hybrid on-prem and cloud, or move everything to the cloud.\nFully on-prem: An obvious option is to buy more hardware and let the research grow into it. This works at modest scale, but cracks appear quickly: new machines can sit underutilized if demand forecasts are wrong, overcommitting can leave you stuck on older hardware generations, supply chain delays become a planning risk, and at large enough scale anything in the cluster can break at any point in time.\nOn-prem with cloud spillover: A common alternative is to keep a strong on-prem baseline and spill into the cloud during peaks. That hedges uncertainties around future demand and build-out, but introduces issues of data gravity (moving or replicating hundreds of PBs is slow and expensive), data integrity (lagging or corrupted replicas producing different results), and environment drift (subtle differences in limits and services between on-prem and cloud). Naive hybrids tend to leak into user code as “if cloud, do X; if on-prem, do Y,” which is exactly the complexity we want to remove from researchers.\nFully cloud: Declaring the cloud home for all workloads avoids hybrid complexity but comes with its own trade-offs: less control over hardware and topology than specialized on-prem builds, ongoing compute and storage costs that accumulate quickly, potential for vendor lock-in and billing surprises, and, at sufficient scale, the same multi-region data-gravity and integrity problems in a different form.\nData gravity and integrity will eventually always become a problem regardless of whether you choose an on-prem or cloud-first solution. We assume multiple on-prem data centers and multiple cloud regions from the start, and we treat those constraints as a first-class rather than edge case.\nWe follow two principles to reduce the data gravity problem: minimize ad-hoc spilling (“just burst this job”) and decide placement up front. For each team, workload and research stage we decide which cluster it runs on and, where possible, move the workload to the data rather than the data to the workload.\nTo make that usable, the platform hides the complexity behind two abstractions.\nCompute is abstracted so clusters, whether on-prem or cloud, sit behind a common interface, and switching placement is a policy or config change, not a big application layer code change.\nData is exposed through a shared catalog that spans on-prem and cloud and abstracts over storage backends such as S3, NFS, Postgres, and Delta Table.\nThe result is high utilization of on-prem capacity, “unlimited” headroom through cloud when genuinely needed, and far fewer surprises from data gravity while keeping researchers focused on what to run, not where it runs.\nFrom Scheduler-Owned DAGs to In-Process Orchestration\nIn the traditional model, a research pipeline builds a computational graph and hands the entire graph to a scheduler such as Slurm. The scheduler owns that graph: it tracks dependencies, decides when nodes are ready, and runs them on the scheduler’s underlying cluster. That works as long as the whole pipeline stays in one environment. It works much less well if you want one stage of the pipeline on an on-prem cluster and another stage on cloud GPUs.\nYou can approximate that by manually splitting the graph into smaller subgraphs and submitting each one to a different scheduler. In practice, that means asking researchers to think in scheduler boundaries, split pipelines into stages, and predict hotspots up front. Given how much we care about research turnaround time, we do not think it is realistic to expect researchers to spend their day hand-carving DAGs to steer placement.\nInstead, we pulled the part that decides “what is ready to run next?” out of the scheduler and into a Python library that lives next to the user’s code. We call that component the GraphRunner.\nIn this model, the GraphRunner owns the computational graph inside the same Python process that built it. It tracks which nodes are ready, and when a node becomes runnable it decides where to send it: an on-prem batch scheduler, a cloud scheduler, or a local thread or process pool. The schedulers no longer see a monolithic DAG; they see individual tasks. Placement decisions move from “which cluster should run this whole pipeline?” to “which cluster should run this node?”\nThat shift lets us route different nodes, branches and stages of a single graph to different clusters, without exposing any of that complexity to the researcher. They write one pipeline; the platform decides, node by node, where it runs.\nClosing thoughts\nResearch at this scale is a moving target. New models, larger datasets and changing market conditions keep pushing the boundaries, and the platform evolves with them. What matters is keeping the loop fast, predictable and correct so researchers can keep pushing forward.\nInterested in working on systems like this?\nSee our openings\nInsights\nRelated Articles\nExperienced, Technology\nChoosing between free threading and async in Python\nAs host of this year’s first PyAmsterdam Meetup, Optiver welcomed the local Python community back to our headquarters for an evening of tech talks, networking and knowledge sharing.

Beginning with version 3.13, CPython introduces an option for a build known as free threading, where the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is removed. The question is: With the GIL gone, do we still need async in Python?\nWatch the talk or read the write-up to see how Samet breaks down the trade-offs and what they could mean for your next Python project.\nIn this blog, I’ll guide you through my talk’s key points and explain how to choose the best concurrency model—synchronous, async, or multi-threading—for your Python projects. We’ll discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and when to choose one over the other—whether you’re handling CPU-bound tasks with threads or I/O-bound workloads with async.\nWith the help of a simple kitchen analogy, you’ll have a clear understanding of which model to use for your specific case, empowering you to make more efficient decisions.\nFirst, what is GIL and why do we have it?\nThe Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) exists mainly to simplify memory management in CPython by preventing race conditions when updating reference counts, which are used to track object lifetimes. This makes the interpreter easier to implement and often more efficient for single-threaded applications. When threads were first introduced in Python, most systems had only a single CPU, so this limitation wasn’t a major concern. The GIL was a practical trade-off to reduce complexity and ensure stability at a time when true parallel execution wasn’t widely needed.\nOver time, however, hardware capabilities have evolved dramatically. Modern machines often come equipped with many CPU cores and leveraging them effectively has become crucial for performance-intensive applications. In this environment, the value of true parallelism—and thus of multi-threading without the constraints of the GIL—has grown significantly.\nIn version 3.13, CPython introduces an option where the GIL can be disabled. This allows threads to truly run at the same time, fully utilising multiple cores and processors. It dramatically improves multi-threaded performance of the Python interpreter.\nTo ease the transition, version 3.13 is to be optionally available as a separate build:\n3.13t\nIt’s without the GIL, allowing for free threading.\nDevelopers can choose to use this version if they want.\nBut how does this affect your choice between synchronous, async, and multi-threading models?\nThe kitchen analogy: three approaches, three scenarios\nImagine a restaurant kitchen where the goal is to prepare a simple meal—a steak and a salad. We’re going to prepare this meal in three different ways.\n1. In kitchen one: A single cook\nThere’s a single cook responsible for all prep from start to finish— seasoning, grilling, resting and plating the steak, then chopping, mixing and plating the salad. A simple and efficient approach if you only have a few customers.\n2. In kitchen two: A multitasking cook\nThere’s still a lone cook, but one who multitasks due to a high number of customers. The key is managing multiple tasks at the same time by breaking them down into smaller steps and switching between them when there’s idle time—only possible when there’s something else (like the grill) doing some of the work.\n3. In kitchen three: Multiple cooks, multiple grills\nThere are multiple cooks working together, yet independently, to execute tasks in a true parallel nature, with multiple steaks and salads being prepared all at the same time. But here kitchen design is a factor. With only one grill, the kitchen’s efficiency is limited. With multiple grills, multiple cooks can all grill steaks simultaneously and therefore faster.\nNow, imagine this restaurant is your Python application.\nFor decades, Python’s GIL has been like having one grill. No matter how many cooks (threads) you hired, they could only take turns using it. But with Python 3.13’s GIL-free build, it’s like Python’s kitchen just hired more cooks and added more grills. Things can finally happen at the same time! This is multi-threading with free-threading enabled.\nBut does this mean async programming is going to be obsolete? Do we still need our efficient multitasking cook?\nTo answer that, we’re going to explore the choice between multi-threading and async programming, and how this decision is influenced by the removal of the GIL, in order to determine which approach is best for your needs.\nSync, async or threads: How to choose the right model?\nSynchronous\nSynchronous programming is the most straightforward and traditional model. Tasks are executed one at a time, from start to finish, in a strict, sequential order. The program waits for each task to complete before moving on to the next one. This simplicity makes it easy to understand, easy to write, and easy to debug. It’s also well-suited for CPU-bound operations where one CPU core is enough.\nReturning to our kitchen, synchronous programming is like the single cook handling every task from start to finish. If you’re preparing a simple meal without interruptions, there’s no need to overcomplicate—just cook one dish at a time. In my opinion, this means synchronous programming should be your default choice especially for simplicity and clarity.\nWhen to use sync:\nOne CPU is enough\nResponsiveness doesn’t matter\nTasks can be executed one after another\nBlocking operations is acceptable, like batch processing that’s part of a data pipeline\nTrade-offs:\nNot efficient if your tasks involve waiting (network requests, file I/O, database queries)\nProgram remains blocked during waiting times\nQuickly becomes a bottleneck in highly responsive scenarios\nIt’s a solid choice for straightforward, single-threaded operations, but it quickly becomes a bottleneck when high responsiveness is required like a user interface or a busy web server.\nAsync\nNow, let’s look at async programming, a model designed for handling I/O-bound tasks more efficiently. The focus here is on multitasking, not parallelism. It’s about breaking down programs into small pieces where tasks are still executed sequentially. Through rapid context switching, it creates the illusion of parallel execution, and it makes programs more responsive.\nThink back to the multitasking cook in our kitchen analogy. If your cook constantly needs to check the grill while also preparing smaller dishes, async programming is your go-to approach. It allows the cook to juggle multiple tasks without extra resources, maintaining responsiveness and efficiency.\nWhen to use async:\nWhen responsiveness matters, but one CPU core is enough.\nYou’re dealing primarily with I/O-bound tasks like network calls, file operations, or databases.\nYour tasks are structured as smaller, independent operations that can interleave efficiently.\nYou want concurrency without managing thread complexities.\nTrade-offs:\nThe learning curve is steeper due to concepts like event loops and task scheduling. It’s a bit more difficult to grasp what’s going on under the hood.\nYou need libraries that are compatible with async; you need to re-write your code.\nDebugging can be tricky.\nNot suitable for CPU-intensive tasks—a single heavy computation can block the event loop.\nDespite this, it is a powerful method for high-concurrency scenarios where responsiveness is crucial.\nMulti-threading (free threading)\nFinally, let’s talk about multi-threading, a model designed to handle CPU-bound tasks at scale. Multi-threading focuses on executing multiple tasks at the same time. Until now, Python’s multi-threading was restricted by the GIL, which means:\nEven if you created multiple threads, only one thread could execute Python bytecode at a time, making it inefficient for cases where the program needs to execute Python code\nFor things like file I/O where operations happen at a low level, multi-threading with GIL can still be effective because GIL will not block this type of I/O operation.\nBut for cases where the program wants to execute Python bytecodes at the same time, the GIL will be a limitation.\nPython 3.13’s GIL-free build (3.13t) removes this limitation, finally enabling true parallelism. If you have a dish that requires intensive preparation—like making a big complex meal from scratch—that requires a lot of work to be done in the kitchen. And you need to prepare many of them at scale. Then adding more cooks is your solution.\nFree threading in Python is exactly that: multiple cooks preparing multiple dishes at once, working together not blocking each other.\nUse free threading when:\nOne CPU just isn’t enough\nPerforming heavy computations like data processing, image manipulation, or mathematical calculations.\nYou can leverage the GIL-free build of version 3.13 for real multi-threading.\nYou need true parallelism across multiple cores.\nNew challenges of multi-threading without the GIL:\nThread safety will be more difficult to achieve. Without the GIL, developers need to carefully handle data access to avoid race conditions.\nLibrary compatibility is another topic. Many existing Python packages are written with the assumption that the GIL provides thread safety.\nWhen GIL is gone most of the available Python packages will have to adapt. It will take time for these libraries to support the free-threading model and ensure compatibility with no-GIL.\nThe good news is lots of progress has been made already. Especially for the machine learning ecosystem, you’ll see that many libraries already support the free-threading version. See https://py-free-threading.github.io/tracking/\nDespite these challenges, multi-threading without the GIL is a major step forward, providing powerful performance improvements for the CPython interpreter.\nKey takeaways\nSynchronous programming: Default choice—simple, effective, best for sequential tasks where responsiveness isn’t critical.\nAsync programming: Perfect for responsive, I/O-bound workloads needing high concurrency, yet limited to a single CPU core.\nFree-threading (Multi-threading): Ideal for tasks that demand true parallel execution across multiple CPU cores—now possible with Python 3.13’s GIL-free build.\nPython without the GIL is a fantastic new tool, but it doesn’t replace async. It simply expands our options. This flexibility lets you precisely choose the right programming model for your Python project’s specific needs.\nInsights\nRelated Articles\nExperienced, Meet the team, Trading\nInside Optiver’s Institutional Trading Team\nAsk five Institutional Traders how they got here, and you'll get five different answers.

Our Career Kickstarter: Women in Tech program invites aspiring female-identifying engineers from across Europe to explore how their coding and problem-solving skills apply to real-world challenges in financial markets.\nWe caught up with Anca, a recent participant who has since joined Optiver as a full-time Software Engineer, to hear how the program shaped her journey – from discovering high-frequency trading for the first time to finding confidence in her career path.\nCan you tell us a bit about your background?\nI studied Computer Science at Babeș-Bolyai University in Romania, where I also did a master’s in Artificial Intelligence. Prior to joining Optiver, I worked as a Full-Stack Software Engineer on a variety of projects, ranging from a car dealership platform to a medical application for the European Union. So I already had some engineering experience, but mostly in more traditional software environments.\nWhy did you want to want to apply for Career Kickstarter, and what were you hoping to get out of the experience?\nI wanted to see what it’s actually like to work in a high-frequency trading firm – to understand the technology, the kinds of problems being solved, and what the culture is like behind it all.\nIn Romania, there isn’t that much awareness about trading firms yet. Until recently, I didn’t really know what they did or if they even hired from my country. But then some people at my university started applying and talking about their experiences, so I became curious and started researching on my own.\nOptiver’s program stood out because it felt serious and well thought out.\nOther programs I found were just one or two days, but this one was a full week, so it felt like something that would really help me grow and learn, not just observe from the sidelines.\nBefore joining, did you have any expectations or worries about working in a male-dominated field?\nIn Romania, computer science is actually quite balanced – my classes were around 50/50, and a lot of my team leads were women. So I’d never experienced the kind of imbalance I’d heard existed in finance.\nI was also a bit nervous that I’d be expected to already know everything. That if I made a mistake, it’d be seen as a bad sign. But that fear completely disappeared after the first day. The trainers created such a comfortable environment where it didn’t matter if you got something wrong – what mattered was thinking out loud, asking questions and learning together. It made me realise that speaking up, even when you’re unsure, is much more valuable than staying quiet.\nThat mindset has really stayed with me, even now in the Academy.\nWas there a particular session in the program that stood out to you?\nYes, the System Design session with Zuotian and Fred. We started from scratch, talking about what an exchange system actually does, and broke it down together. What data comes in? What do we send out? What needs to happen in between?\nIt was all leading up to us building our own version of an exchange in teams, so everything we discussed had a purpose.\nAt one point, I gave a design suggestion, and the trainer smiled and said, “Is that what would work best in a live trading scenario?” That moment clicked. I realised I’d jumped straight to a solution without really understanding the problem. It’s a completely different kind of challenge than what I’m used to, which made me want to explore more.\nWhat I found most interesting was how the technical priorities in trading are so different from those in other industries. In my previous roles, the goal was always high availability, meaning that your system should never crash. But in trading, it’s actually better to restart completely than to risk acting on inconsistent data. That completely changed the way I thought about system design.\nHow did the experience change your view of what tech careers at Optiver are like?\nIt gave me a completely different view. I realised how much potential there is for growth – not just technically, but personally too. Everyone is incredibly talented, but it never felt competitive. People genuinely want you to succeed.\nI never felt like I was being assessed. The trainers gave constant feedback and genuinely cared about our progress, even knowing not everyone would receive an offer. It always felt like they were there to help us improve.\nWe also weren’t isolated in one room for the week. We got to meet engineers across the company, so it felt like we were part of the team.\nNow that you’ve joined as a full-time graduate and are getting onboarded at the Optiver Academy, how do you think the program prepared you for this step?\nThe program gave me a strong foundation in both technical and trading concepts, and now I can really see how everything connects.\nDuring Career Kickstarter, we focused a lot on the exchange side of trading, understanding how orders are processed and how systems communicate. Now, at the Academy, I’m seeing the other side: how the pricing engines are built and how all those components interact. It’s helping me piece together the full picture of how trading technology works in practice.\nWhat I love most is that the sessions are led by people who actually built these systems from the ground up, sometimes 10 or 15 years ago. You get to ask questions directly to the people who designed the tools we’re now learning to use, and that’s pretty special.\nWhat would you tell other women in engineering or computer science who are thinking about applying?\nBe bold from day one. Don’t hold back from asking questions or sharing your ideas, even if you’re unsure. You’ll be surprised how much you can learn when you just speak up and stay curious.\nAnd don’t worry if you don’t have any finance knowledge. I came in with no experience in that area, and the way Optiver explains things makes it feel very intuitive. The trainers guide you through concepts in a way that feels natural, like you’re discovering the logic yourself.\nThe program really does challenge you, but in the best way possible. It pushes you to understand things deeply, not just at a surface level. In my previous roles, there were always parts of the system that stayed a bit of a black box – you’d make assumptions and move on.\nHere, you start from the ground up, understanding how every component works and connects. That kind of depth makes you much more confident in what you’re building.\nIf you could give your past self advice before applying, what would it be?\nI’d tell myself to stop overthinking and just apply. You’ll come out of it feeling more confident, more inspired, and with a much clearer sense of what you want to do next.\nReady to engineer your future?\nOptiver’s Career Kickstarter: Women in Tech program is designed to help you explore what a career in technology within trading really looks like.

One word: Data.\nData science and research are at the very core of Optiver’s pricing strategies. Our teams tackle challenges at the intersection of technology and trading – where some of the most complex and valuable financial market data resides. With world-class skills that cut through the noise, Optiver’s data science and research teams directly contribute to the precision and scalability of our trading business.\ndata science\nFind YourPerfect Fit\nData analytics\nIt all starts with the exchanges, where we monitor a constant stream of trades and prices. All of this information must be collected, processed and relayed to both human traders and automated strategies alike.\nThese data sets present their own complexities, including a typically very low signal-to-noise ratio. Our analysts must combine data science with a solid understanding of data lineage and trading dynamics to cut through the noise. In this way, we can continuously improve trading logics and remain performant even during periods of market turbulence.\nData science\nData scientists at Optiver apply their advanced engineering and machine learning skills to develop and improve our trading strategies. They sit on our trading floor – the beating heart of our business – to share market insights with traders, quantitative researchers and developers. Our data scientists’ observations and recommendations inform crucial trading decisions in real-time, making them trusted and highly-valued colleagues.\nOptiver’s data scientists collaborate with data analysts, data engineers, quantitative researchers and traders. It’s a fascinating role that requires a strong coding background and problem-solving skills.\nMathematical modelling\nOptiver’s researchers develop sophisticated models that take market dynamics into account to consistently price tens of thousands of instruments. These models must be flexible enough to account for the nuances of the market while at the same time remaining sound and robust. By working together with traders and software engineers, our researchers strive to continuously unlock solutions that further strengthen our pricing.\nMachine learning\nMachine learning is heavily utilised at Optiver to predict how markets might perform in the future. Based on these implied findings, data scientists convert immense amounts of historical data into trading signals. The goal is improving our prediction accuracy. To do so, Optiver is constantly looking for innovative ways to derive useful insights from the data.\nInfrastructure & pipeline\nOptiver’s data science activities wouldn’t exist without our state-of-the-art data infrastructure. Our growing team of data engineers is dedicated to building a cutting-edge, big data pipeline to ensure the real-time availability of terabytes of market data. Each year our Amsterdam office alone processes market data in the magnitude of petabytes. With the help of highly skilled data analysts, who combine data processing skills with a thorough understanding of strategies, we make sure the data tells a story.\nQuantitative research\nQuantitative research is the foundation upon which Optiver’s trading activities are built. Our research teams – experts with MSc and PhD degrees in a variety of STEM subjects – utilise a scientific approach to research and design our world-class trading algorithms. This means applying and developing state-of-the-art stochastic models to price options and predict market volatility, as well as utilising Monte Carlo methods to determine how to perform differentiation on discrete realisations of stochastic processes. Our researchers develop statistical arbitrage strategies by working with petabytes of low latency, high-frequency market data sets, an extensive high-powered computing back-testing framework and much more.\nOptiver’s researchers, steeped in academic methods, invite their teammates and traders to challenge each hypothesis. Can it be mathematically improved? Does it pose a potential risk? Does it exploit a market behavioural pattern? Can it sustain its output goals? Constant testing, analysis, refinement and innovation ensure our quantitative models remain at the cutting-edge of capital markets.\nLearn more\nsubheader\nAshley – Amsterdam\n“The industry itself is ever-evolving and becoming a bigger part of modern society’s development.

          "content": "Back\nExperienced  ·  January 23, 2026\nInside Optiver’s Institutional Trading Team\nAsk five Institutional Traders how they got here, and you’ll get five different answers.\nOptiver’s Institutional Trading team bridges external markets and our internal trading desks. They manage broker relationships, interpret voice-brokered market flow and use these real-time insights to inform their trading decisions. It’s a role built around a unique blend of strong communication, sharp market intuition and quantitative thinking. But how these skills combine depends entirely on the desk.\nOn S&P, traders rely heavily on speed, decisiveness and execution. On Single Stock Options, negotiation, timing and long-term relationship building hold more weight.\nThat’s why you’ll find traders who started their careers in sales, consulting and technology sitting alongside former asset managers and brokers. Diverse backgrounds, different strengths, each matched to the desk where they’ll best fit.\nTo show this in practice, five Institutional Traders from our London and Amsterdam team share how their career experiences helped them succeed in a role few expected, along with practical advice for anyone considering a similar path.\nMeet the team\nMaarten | Index\nFinance and Economics graduate with a background in asset management sales.\nSophie | Single Stock Options\nEconomics graduate who spent a year on Amazon’s Business Graduate Scheme.\nMartin | S&P\nBusiness Administration graduate who started in commercial real estate.\nPatrick | Commodities\nExperienced volatility trader with a decade spent across leading market-making firms.\nFerdinand | Single Stock Options\nFormer broker with 14 years’ experience across Amsterdam, Geneva and Hong Kong.\nExplore the article\nPart 1: How five team members found their fit\nThere’s no “right” background for an Institutional Trader at Optiver. Some joined from brokerage or market making, others from sales, asset management or entirely different industries. Most didn’t even know this role existed. So how did they end up here—and how did they know they’d be a fit?\nWhat was your path into Institutional Trading?\nSophie: I had pretty much zero financial background beyond a few modules during my Economics degree. After university, I spent a year at Amazon speaking to a lot of clients and helping sellers grow their businesses. It gave me a good foundation for relationship management, so I wanted to apply that somewhere more analytical and fast-paced.\nFerdinand: I started as a broker on the live trading floor when I was 19. I planned to try it before university and loved it so much I never went back. Over my career, I regularly interacted with Optiver as a client. So when I returned to Amsterdam they reached out to see if I’d be interested in Institutional Trading. For me, it was a great opportunity to see it from the other side.\nMaarten: I worked at an investment bank where most of my time was spent reading about markets and advising institutional investors. In asset management sales, I found myself talking about what was happening but not steering anything. I wanted something more varied where I could apply my financial knowledge and actually influence outcomes. I found that in this seat.\nPatrick: This is my third market-making firm over a 10-year career. My first experience taught me core market-making principles across multiple products on the floor, which is definitely beneficial as a young trader. I then moved to a role where I could integrate my product knowledge and broker relationships in a more technical environment with an execution focus.Institutional Trading felt like the natural step to take all that experience to the next level: becoming a more intelligent volatility trader, taking larger positions and feeling integral to the market I’m trading.\nMartin: After graduating, I worked in commercial real estate. Different from trading but it gave me a solid grounding in market fundamentals, professionalism and relationship building, skills that transferred surprisingly well when I learned about the role.\nWhy did this opportunity stand out to you, given your background and interests?\nSophie: I hadn’t come across many jobs that require such a blend of technical and people skills. Most roles lean heavily one way or the other. I’ve always been more of an all-rounder and I wanted something more technical than pure sales, but not something purely quantitative either. That middle ground is rare to find.\nMaarten: I knew Optiver by name but didn’t know this role existed. I thought all traders here had very quant heavy backgrounds. I like working in a quantitative capacity, but I wouldn’t describe myself as a quant.The sales and relationships management skills from my previous role apply well to brokers and counterparties you speak to daily here. You have to combine all the different aspects, thinking on your feet, communicating effectively, collaborating well and you have to have some theoretical understanding of what goes into a quote. That combination of the analytical side of trading with that human aspect was exciting.\nMartin: When I first saw the role, I didn’t have a clear picture of what an Institutional Trader actually did. What appealed to me during the interviews was the internal versus external communication aspect, being the voice to the market while also working with the trading desk in real time. I’m quite sociable. I like working with people more than just staring at screens and code.\nFerdinand: I wanted to challenge myself to grow and compete on a different level. Compared to the brokerage industry, the environment here changes every day. It was the opportunity to grow within the firm and to have impact at the desk level and the firm level depending on the market you’re looking at. I love the game-like element of the role. It’s a combination of chess and poker, thinking a few steps ahead while reading the person on the other side of the phone.\n“I hadn’t come across many jobs that require such a blend of technical and people skills. Most roles lean heavily one way or the other. That middle ground is rare to find.”— Sophie\nPart 2: Learning at the desk\nOnce in the role, every trader faces a learning curve. Success depends not just on how quickly they can adapt, but how well they use their existing strengths to make an impact on the trading floor. We asked the team what it was like to join their desk, and what makes it different from other traditional trading roles.\nWhat do you enjoy most about your day-to-day work?\nFerdinand: Three things. First, the focus on development and education. I wish I’d had a mentor or training programme like what we provide when I was starting out. The training is both theoretical and mental and gives you the tools to handle the high-pressure environment. You receive almost constant feedback from your team and from counterparties. As a mentor, I get to guide people through that.Second, competing with the rest of the world. We compare ourselves to top athletes and it’s easy to forget how much work goes into performing at that level. Looking back and seeing how far you’ve come and the impact you’re having on the trading floor is the best feeling you can have.Finally, it’s the relationships we build. It’s very competitive and the people we talk to are also the best in their markets. We build such a high level of trust that even if one side makes a mistake, it doesn’t get personal. We know both sides are there for the long term and that we’ll still need each other for the next 20 trades that day or the next 10,000 trades in my career.\nMaarten: That’s easy, the trading part. That’s what we do on a daily basis and in times of volatility, it really shows our value add as a market maker to improve liquidity. It’s the most challenging time as you have to prioritise well, take on more risk, communicate well and make split-second decisions.The energy on the floor is something you can feel the moment you step in.\nPatrick: Being a market maker specifically, every single day is effectively a new problem. You can apply past experience to what’s currently happening in the market but when you walk in, you really don’t know what’s going to happen that day. There’s immediate feedback too, from PnL, your peers, your desk. You can tell immediately if you’re trading well and if not, you can change things quickly to trade better.\nMartin: When I look back, I can see how much I’ve grown and improved while doing the job. Business trips are a good example. Initially, they were solely focused on meeting people and engaging with them. Over time, they evolved into building deeper connections and strengthening long-term relationships. Now, my trips are centred around understanding the markets and identifying new business opportunities through my network. I trade every day but it’s a continuous evolution.\n“Every single day is effectively a new problem. You can apply past experience to what’s currently happening in the market but when you walk in, you really don’t know what’s going to happen that day.” — Patrick\nWhat’s been your biggest learning since joining the team?\nMartin: A quote that stuck with me is “get everything up to par.” Know the competencies you need for the job, get them to a functional level, then focus on what you’re good at. I knew my mathematical skills were behind, so I invested time there. I didn’t need to be the strongest at options theory but I needed to be strong enough so I could lean into my communication strengths. Working on competencies is an ongoing process. Even after all these years, I still see areas where I can improve. Challenging others and being challenged in return is how we grow and get better together.\nFerdinand: For me, it’s the mindset shift. I had a very different background from most of the team, so I had no idea if I would be successful or not. But you realise that with the right mentality you can keep learning, growing and developing at a high level whatever career stage you’re in. It’s like being a footballer. You don’t need to be a superstar in your first game, but you can get there with effort and belief in yourself.I knew my strength was in relationships, so I focused on catching up on the more technical side, formulas, automation, everything that was further from my background.\nMaarten: You’re never done learning. The job description sounds straightforward, represent Optiver’s quotes, execute in the market. The reality is there are so many different markets and products, each with their own nuances. Every situation requires a different approach.Every day brings new challenges, from market moves to competitive pressure to counterparty interactions. It’s a role that keeps you alert, engaged and always on your toes.\nPatrick: Being more comfortable with more calculated risk. We spend a lot of time developing trading plans and discussing how we would want to react should certain situations happen in the market, expected or unexpected. This allows us to be confident in our volatility calculations so we can react confidently to capitalise on those markets. I’m more proactive with my trading here and we’re much more of an active market participant.\nWhat sets Institutional Trading apart from other trading roles you’ve experienced?\nPatrick: Institutional Traders and Quant Traders work on products together, so there’s a significant uptick in teamwork, sharing trading decisions and bouncing ideas off each other in real time. At other firms, there’s often a greater focus on execution or PnL specifically tied to voice flow. Here, you’re positioned at the frontline of external markets, translating critical market insights directly back to the team. Even on a busy desk, your insights hold real weight.\nMaarten: The impact we have is more noticeable at Optiver because of how flat and how collaborative the environment is. It doesn’t really matter which role you start in, there are so many opportunities to add value. If you spot a market opportunity or a better way for the team to work, you can discuss this directly with the team and create the buy-in needed to move forward and chase the opportunity.\nPart 3: Key skills and advice from the team\nWhile no two desks are the same, certain skills show up across the board. Here, the team shares what they believe makes a great Institutional Trader, and finally, what advice they’d give to someone considering this path.\nIn your experience, what are the most important skills to succeed as an IT?\nFerdinand: Reasoning speed is crucial. You operate in a fast-paced environment where you need to digest and filter information quickly and build a game plan from it. It’s about connecting your competencies—relationship management, negotiation, communication and trading knowledge—and maximising the outcome that comes from combining all of them effectively.\nMaarten: It’s a combination of skills. It’s important to be strong on the relationship side, as we speak to brokers and direct counterparties every day. You need to communicate effectively both internally and externally while also having a solid analytical foundation to understand the trading decisions.\nSophie: The ability to read between the lines is really important. You need to apply common sense and context to critically assess what someone is saying versus what they actually mean which comes with time and practice. You also have to be able to work well under pressure. Sometimes my heart rate spikes, but the adrenaline in those moments makes it fun and the decisions you make under those conditions can have a big impact on PnL.\nPatrick: Strong attention to detail and the ability to multitask are essential. Be effective with the words you use and how you interact with externals, internals and with the systems you work with. You must be able to learn from both your mistakes and your wins. You also have to be a good ambassador for Optiver. In the Institutional Trading role, you interact with external counterparties every day and each interaction leaves them with an impression of the company based on how you present yourself.\n“There is no single definition of a strong Institutional Trader. Not everyone on the team has the same strengths or weaknesses, and different markets value different things. Don’t try to copy someone else, focus on being the best version of yourself.”— Martin\nAny tips or insights you’d share with someone exploring a role like this?\nMartin: Be open, reflective and above all, proactive. You are in the driver’s seat of your career at Optiver. We ensure the right training and coaching are available, but ultimately, you are the one who has to put in the work. Use the smart people around you to steepen your learning curve. There is no single definition of a strong Institutional Trader. Not everyone on the team has the same strengths or weaknesses and different markets value different things. Don’t try to copy someone else, focus on being the best version of yourself.\nFerdinand: It is addictive to compete with the best in the world. Embrace the pressure of a fast and dynamic environment, you know you will perform when the market is moving. We want people to reach a point where they enjoy the game because they know they have mastered the right skills and can apply them confidently in their day-to-day work.\nPatrick: Ask as many questions as you can and realise that there is a takeaway from every trading moment, whether it’s good or bad. Being highly curious is one of the most important drivers of success in this role. You can’t be passive or sit back waiting for others to teach you. If something doesn’t make sense, be intellectually curious enough to research it yourself, understand whether it’s relevant to how you trade and then speak to the people who can explain it. If you don’t understand something, the worst thing you can do is ignore it.\nSophie: Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that held me back in the beginning. I didn’t want to say something that sounded stupid. But if you don’t ask, you won’t grow. Lastly, I’d say have fun and enjoy the ride. It’s an incredibly interesting environment where you’re on top of the markets all day and can really feel the buzz when things get busy.\nEvery Institutional Trader brings something different to the team, and there’s no single background that defines success.

          "content": "Back\nLife at Optiver  ·  December 19, 2025\nFrom FutureFocus to Optiver’s quant trading internship\nQuantitative finance isn’t usually part of a STEM curriculum, so most students don’t consider the trading industry as a potential career.\nFutureFocus is an educational program that gives students an inside look at the challenges our technology, trading, and research teams face everyday. Through lectures, workshops, and hands-on projects, students explore how these areas come together to solve complex problems. For some, this program isn’t just a crash course in options theory, modeling, and problem-solving—it’s the first step toward a summer internship. After five days of learning, top-performers may be invited to return as interns.\nTwo participants from our Chicago Quants program did exactly that. Here’s how they describe the shift from FutureFocus to a quant trading internship.\nAlan\nMajor: Mathematics and Computer Science\nUniversity: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nEthan\nMajor: Mathematics and Physics\nUniversity: New York University\nHow did your experience in FutureFocus prepare you for your internship?\nAlan: We covered a ton of ground in just five days, especially with options theory. That quick deep dive made the possibility of an internship even more exciting because we’d go more in depth on the concepts that were hard to fully grasp with just online resources. The trading games and coding project also gave me a head start because they made similar activities during the internship feel more familiar.\nEthan: It gave me a good sense of what to expect. I was already familiar with how Optiver operates, which made it easier to jump into new challenges during the internship.\nWhat’s been your favorite part of the internship?\nAlan: I enjoy how collaborative it is. Everyone’s genuinely excited to explore tough problems and jump into projects that benefit the whole class. We all have the same goals, so it’s about learning together and not competing against each other.\nEthan: Definitely the growth-oriented environment. I’ve always prioritized self-reflection and trying to be a better version of myself, and Optiver really supports that. Even in just ten weeks, I’ve had tons of opportunities to push myself and grow.\n“We all have the same goals, so it’s about learning together and not competing against each other.”\nWhat advice would you give to someone attending FutureFocus?\nAlan: Be ready for a fast-paced week of problem-solving. It’s intense but really rewarding if you give it your full attention. You don’t really need to prep ahead of time, but having some Python experience would definitely help.\nEthan: FutureFocus is a great way to figure out if trading is something you’d really enjoy. It’s a unique week-long experience where you’ll get a solid intro to what trading actually involves and learn a ton of new material. Use it as a chance to explore Optiver and see if this industry’s the right fit for you.\nFutureFocus is designed to give participants a realistic look at the work our teams do. They walk away with a better understanding of how trading, research, and technology interact, and what it feels like to work in a collaborative environment.\nIf you’re ready to challenge yourself and get a view into the trading industry, FutureFocus is the perfect place to start.\nReady to dive in?\nFind your program\nInsights\nRelated Articles\nLife at Optiver, Technology\nInterning on Optiver’s Austin HFT Team\nFormer software engineer intern Ethan shares what it was like to build production systems on Optiver’s Austin high-frequency trading team.\nLearn more\nLife at Optiver\nBreaking down the trading industry: Which role is right for you?\nIf you’re curious about a career in STEM, you’ve probably thought about big tech or academia–but have you thought about trading?

          "title": "Research at Scale: Orchestrating ML for Systematic Trading",
          "content": "Back\nTechnology  ·  December 18, 2025\nResearch at Scale: Orchestrating ML for Systematic Trading\nThis article is adapted from a technical talk delivered by Rob Hahn, our Global Head of Optiver Research Platform, at Optiver’s Chicago office.\nSystematic trading rests on the strength of its research engine. Experiments run today to become tomorrow’s models, signals, risk checks, and position limits. End-to-end research turnaround time should be a core operating target for any desk aiming to compete. The research cycle is simple to state: form a hypothesis, run experiments, evaluate results, then either refine the hypothesis or translate the results into production decisions. The hard part is running this cycle repeatably across thousands of instruments and decades of market data. Here’s how we approach this problem and the engineering choices that made a difference.\nWhat a Research Platform Must Optimize\nWe keep one goal in front of everything else: shorten the loop from idea to validated result. Cost, capacity, capability, and correctness all serve that goal.\nCost: HPC is expensive, so efficiency matters. If you can run twice the compute per dollar, that’s a real competitive edge.\nCapacity: Have enough headroom to avoid blocking the business while keeping usage high. Wasting budget is not an option, and neither is throttling research.\nCapability: A good research platform anticipates the direction of the business and what it needs to allow growth and success not just today but 12 to 24 months from now.\nCorrectness: Reproducibility and traceability are nonnegotiable. If results can’t be recreated, you’re burning cycles, not doing research.\nWhen Pipelines Scale Up\nOn paper, a research pipeline looks linear: generate features, train models, run simulations. Reality bends it out of shape. If feature generation for a single market day takes one hour, about 1,000 trading days will take roughly six weeks of end-to-end runtime. Shard feature generation by day and the runtime drops back down to about an hour, although total computational time stays the same. Now, attempt to generate features for 100 instruments, and you will soon be looking at 100,000+ feature generation jobs. Serialized, the original six weeks turned into roughly 11 years of runtime by changing just one requirement. Parallelism stops being a choice.\nResearchers tend to think about pipelines as mostly linear flows. Once parallelism becomes mandatory, that mental model breaks down. It becomes hard to reason how the underlying computational graph should be structured for maximum throughput and utilization. Without careful shaping, a pipeline that looks simple on a whiteboard can create sharp hotspots in its resource usage. Layer on other dimensions such as team headcount, model and simulation complexity, and you are quickly dealing with a combinatorial explosion that is impossible to optimize by hand.\nA small fraction of a computational graph. The fan-out and convergence patterns already make it hard to reason about by hand, and forcing researchers to operate at this level leads to bottlenecks and wasted compute. The platform is designed to handle that complexity for them.\nThat combinatorial explosion doesn’t just make graphs hard to reason about; it also slams into hard capacity limits quickly. Before we simplify how researchers express pipelines, we need to make sure there is enough compute to run them.\nAddressing Compute Capacity\nIn practice, there are three ways to scale compute capacity: go all-in on on-prem, run hybrid on-prem and cloud, or move everything to the cloud.\nFully on-prem: An obvious option is to buy more hardware and let the research grow into it. This works at modest scale, but cracks appear quickly: new machines can sit underutilized if demand forecasts are wrong, overcommitting can leave you stuck on older hardware generations, supply chain delays become a planning risk, and at large enough scale anything in the cluster can break at any point in time.\nOn-prem with cloud spillover: A common alternative is to keep a strong on-prem baseline and spill into the cloud during peaks. That hedges uncertainties around future demand and build-out, but introduces issues of data gravity (moving or replicating hundreds of PBs is slow and expensive), data integrity (lagging or corrupted replicas producing different results), and environment drift (subtle differences in limits and services between on-prem and cloud). Naive hybrids tend to leak into user code as “if cloud, do X; if on-prem, do Y,” which is exactly the complexity we want to remove from researchers.\nFully cloud: Declaring the cloud home for all workloads avoids hybrid complexity but comes with its own trade-offs: less control over hardware and topology than specialized on-prem builds, ongoing compute and storage costs that accumulate quickly, potential for vendor lock-in and billing surprises, and, at sufficient scale, the same multi-region data-gravity and integrity problems in a different form.\nData gravity and integrity will eventually always become a problem regardless of whether you choose an on-prem or cloud-first solution. We assume multiple on-prem data centers and multiple cloud regions from the start, and we treat those constraints as a first-class rather than edge case.\nWe follow two principles to reduce the data gravity problem: minimize ad-hoc spilling (“just burst this job”) and decide placement up front. For each team, workload and research stage we decide which cluster it runs on and, where possible, move the workload to the data rather than the data to the workload.\nTo make that usable, the platform hides the complexity behind two abstractions.\nCompute is abstracted so clusters, whether on-prem or cloud, sit behind a common interface, and switching placement is a policy or config change, not a big application layer code change.\nData is exposed through a shared catalog that spans on-prem and cloud and abstracts over storage backends such as S3, NFS, Postgres, and Delta Table.\nThe result is high utilization of on-prem capacity, “unlimited” headroom through cloud when genuinely needed, and far fewer surprises from data gravity while keeping researchers focused on what to run, not where it runs.\nFrom Scheduler-Owned DAGs to In-Process Orchestration\nIn the traditional model, a research pipeline builds a computational graph and hands the entire graph to a scheduler such as Slurm. The scheduler owns that graph: it tracks dependencies, decides when nodes are ready, and runs them on the scheduler’s underlying cluster. That works as long as the whole pipeline stays in one environment. It works much less well if you want one stage of the pipeline on an on-prem cluster and another stage on cloud GPUs.\nYou can approximate that by manually splitting the graph into smaller subgraphs and submitting each one to a different scheduler. In practice, that means asking researchers to think in scheduler boundaries, split pipelines into stages, and predict hotspots up front. Given how much we care about research turnaround time, we do not think it is realistic to expect researchers to spend their day hand-carving DAGs to steer placement.\nInstead, we pulled the part that decides “what is ready to run next?” out of the scheduler and into a Python library that lives next to the user’s code. We call that component the GraphRunner.\nIn this model, the GraphRunner owns the computational graph inside the same Python process that built it. It tracks which nodes are ready, and when a node becomes runnable it decides where to send it: an on-prem batch scheduler, a cloud scheduler, or a local thread or process pool. The schedulers no longer see a monolithic DAG; they see individual tasks. Placement decisions move from “which cluster should run this whole pipeline?” to “which cluster should run this node?”\nThat shift lets us route different nodes, branches and stages of a single graph to different clusters, without exposing any of that complexity to the researcher. They write one pipeline; the platform decides, node by node, where it runs.\nClosing thoughts\nResearch at this scale is a moving target. New models, larger datasets and changing market conditions keep pushing the boundaries, and the platform evolves with them. What matters is keeping the loop fast, predictable and correct so researchers can keep pushing forward.\nInterested in working on systems like this?\nSee our openings\nInsights\nRelated Articles\nExperienced, Technology\nChoosing between free threading and async in Python\nAs host of this year’s first PyAmsterdam Meetup, Optiver welcomed the local Python community back to our headquarters for an evening of tech talks, networking and knowledge sharing.

          "content": "Back\nExperienced  ·  December 2, 2025\nChoosing between free threading and async in Python\nAt this year’s EuroPython, Optiver Senior Software Engineer and Team Lead Samet Yaslan delivered a timely talk for developers working on performance-critical systems: “Choosing between free threading and async.”\nSamet’s session was sparked by a significant change to CPython. Beginning with version 3.13, CPython introduces an option for a build known as free threading, where the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is removed. The question is: With the GIL gone, do we still need async in Python?\nWatch the talk or read the write-up to see how Samet breaks down the trade-offs and what they could mean for your next Python project.\nIn this blog, I’ll guide you through my talk’s key points and explain how to choose the best concurrency model—synchronous, async, or multi-threading—for your Python projects. We’ll discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and when to choose one over the other—whether you’re handling CPU-bound tasks with threads or I/O-bound workloads with async.\nWith the help of a simple kitchen analogy, you’ll have a clear understanding of which model to use for your specific case, empowering you to make more efficient decisions.\nFirst, what is GIL and why do we have it?\nThe Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) exists mainly to simplify memory management in CPython by preventing race conditions when updating reference counts, which are used to track object lifetimes. This makes the interpreter easier to implement and often more efficient for single-threaded applications. When threads were first introduced in Python, most systems had only a single CPU, so this limitation wasn’t a major concern. The GIL was a practical trade-off to reduce complexity and ensure stability at a time when true parallel execution wasn’t widely needed.\nOver time, however, hardware capabilities have evolved dramatically. Modern machines often come equipped with many CPU cores and leveraging them effectively has become crucial for performance-intensive applications. In this environment, the value of true parallelism—and thus of multi-threading without the constraints of the GIL—has grown significantly.\nIn version 3.13, CPython introduces an option where the GIL can be disabled. This allows threads to truly run at the same time, fully utilising multiple cores and processors. It dramatically improves multi-threaded performance of the Python interpreter.\nTo ease the transition, version 3.13 is to be optionally available as a separate build:\n3.13t\nIt’s without the GIL, allowing for free threading.\nDevelopers can choose to use this version if they want.\nBut how does this affect your choice between synchronous, async, and multi-threading models?\nThe kitchen analogy: three approaches, three scenarios\nImagine a restaurant kitchen where the goal is to prepare a simple meal—a steak and a salad. We’re going to prepare this meal in three different ways.\n1. In kitchen one: A single cook\nThere’s a single cook responsible for all prep from start to finish— seasoning, grilling, resting and plating the steak, then chopping, mixing and plating the salad. A simple and efficient approach if you only have a few customers.\n2. In kitchen two: A multitasking cook\nThere’s still a lone cook, but one who multitasks due to a high number of customers. The key is managing multiple tasks at the same time by breaking them down into smaller steps and switching between them when there’s idle time—only possible when there’s something else (like the grill) doing some of the work.\n3. In kitchen three: Multiple cooks, multiple grills\nThere are multiple cooks working together, yet independently, to execute tasks in a true parallel nature, with multiple steaks and salads being prepared all at the same time. But here kitchen design is a factor. With only one grill, the kitchen’s efficiency is limited. With multiple grills, multiple cooks can all grill steaks simultaneously and therefore faster.\nNow, imagine this restaurant is your Python application.\nFor decades, Python’s GIL has been like having one grill. No matter how many cooks (threads) you hired, they could only take turns using it. But with Python 3.13’s GIL-free build, it’s like Python’s kitchen just hired more cooks and added more grills. Things can finally happen at the same time! This is multi-threading with free-threading enabled.\nBut does this mean async programming is going to be obsolete? Do we still need our efficient multitasking cook?\nTo answer that, we’re going to explore the choice between multi-threading and async programming, and how this decision is influenced by the removal of the GIL, in order to determine which approach is best for your needs.\nSync, async or threads: How to choose the right model?\nSynchronous\nSynchronous programming is the most straightforward and traditional model. Tasks are executed one at a time, from start to finish, in a strict, sequential order. The program waits for each task to complete before moving on to the next one. This simplicity makes it easy to understand, easy to write, and easy to debug. It’s also well-suited for CPU-bound operations where one CPU core is enough.\nReturning to our kitchen, synchronous programming is like the single cook handling every task from start to finish. If you’re preparing a simple meal without interruptions, there’s no need to overcomplicate—just cook one dish at a time. In my opinion, this means synchronous programming should be your default choice especially for simplicity and clarity.\nWhen to use sync:\nOne CPU is enough\nResponsiveness doesn’t matter\nTasks can be executed one after another\nBlocking operations is acceptable, like batch processing that’s part of a data pipeline\nTrade-offs:\nNot efficient if your tasks involve waiting (network requests, file I/O, database queries)\nProgram remains blocked during waiting times\nQuickly becomes a bottleneck in highly responsive scenarios\nIt’s a solid choice for straightforward, single-threaded operations, but it quickly becomes a bottleneck when high responsiveness is required like a user interface or a busy web server.\nAsync\nNow, let’s look at async programming, a model designed for handling I/O-bound tasks more efficiently. The focus here is on multitasking, not parallelism. It’s about breaking down programs into small pieces where tasks are still executed sequentially. Through rapid context switching, it creates the illusion of parallel execution, and it makes programs more responsive.\nThink back to the multitasking cook in our kitchen analogy. If your cook constantly needs to check the grill while also preparing smaller dishes, async programming is your go-to approach. It allows the cook to juggle multiple tasks without extra resources, maintaining responsiveness and efficiency.\nWhen to use async:\nWhen responsiveness matters, but one CPU core is enough.\nYou’re dealing primarily with I/O-bound tasks like network calls, file operations, or databases.\nYour tasks are structured as smaller, independent operations that can interleave efficiently.\nYou want concurrency without managing thread complexities.\nTrade-offs:\nThe learning curve is steeper due to concepts like event loops and task scheduling. It’s a bit more difficult to grasp what’s going on under the hood.\nYou need libraries that are compatible with async; you need to re-write your code.\nDebugging can be tricky.\nNot suitable for CPU-intensive tasks—a single heavy computation can block the event loop.\nDespite this, it is a powerful method for high-concurrency scenarios where responsiveness is crucial.\nMulti-threading (free threading)\nFinally, let’s talk about multi-threading, a model designed to handle CPU-bound tasks at scale. Multi-threading focuses on executing multiple tasks at the same time. Until now, Python’s multi-threading was restricted by the GIL, which means:\nEven if you created multiple threads, only one thread could execute Python bytecode at a time, making it inefficient for cases where the program needs to execute Python code\nFor things like file I/O where operations happen at a low level, multi-threading with GIL can still be effective because GIL will not block this type of I/O operation.\nBut for cases where the program wants to execute Python bytecodes at the same time, the GIL will be a limitation.\nPython 3.13’s GIL-free build (3.13t) removes this limitation, finally enabling true parallelism. If you have a dish that requires intensive preparation—like making a big complex meal from scratch—that requires a lot of work to be done in the kitchen. And you need to prepare many of them at scale. Then adding more cooks is your solution.\nFree threading in Python is exactly that: multiple cooks preparing multiple dishes at once, working together not blocking each other.\nUse free threading when:\nOne CPU just isn’t enough\nPerforming heavy computations like data processing, image manipulation, or mathematical calculations.\nYou can leverage the GIL-free build of version 3.13 for real multi-threading.\nYou need true parallelism across multiple cores.\nNew challenges of multi-threading without the GIL:\nThread safety will be more difficult to achieve. Without the GIL, developers need to carefully handle data access to avoid race conditions.\nLibrary compatibility is another topic. Many existing Python packages are written with the assumption that the GIL provides thread safety.\nWhen GIL is gone most of the available Python packages will have to adapt. It will take time for these libraries to support the free-threading model and ensure compatibility with no-GIL.\nThe good news is lots of progress has been made already. Especially for the machine learning ecosystem, you’ll see that many libraries already support the free-threading version. See https://py-free-threading.github.io/tracking/\nDespite these challenges, multi-threading without the GIL is a major step forward, providing powerful performance improvements for the CPython interpreter.\nKey takeaways\nSynchronous programming: Default choice—simple, effective, best for sequential tasks where responsiveness isn’t critical.\nAsync programming: Perfect for responsive, I/O-bound workloads needing high concurrency, yet limited to a single CPU core.\nFree-threading (Multi-threading): Ideal for tasks that demand true parallel execution across multiple CPU cores—now possible with Python 3.13’s GIL-free build.\nPython without the GIL is a fantastic new tool, but it doesn’t replace async. It simply expands our options. This flexibility lets you precisely choose the right programming model for your Python project’s specific needs.\nInsights\nRelated Articles\nExperienced, Meet the team, Trading\nInside Optiver’s Institutional Trading Team\nAsk five Institutional Traders how they got here, and you'll get five different answers.

          "title": "Career Kickstarter Tech: The ‘why’ behind every trading system",
          "content": "Back\nMeet the team  ·  October 28, 2025\nCareer Kickstarter Tech: The ‘why’ behind every trading system\nAt Optiver, our engineers work on some of the most advanced systems in the world, solving unique challenges that combine performance, efficiency and real-time decision-making. Our Career Kickstarter: Women in Tech program invites aspiring female-identifying engineers from across Europe to explore how their coding and problem-solving skills apply to real-world challenges in financial markets.\nWe caught up with Anca, a recent participant who has since joined Optiver as a full-time Software Engineer, to hear how the program shaped her journey – from discovering high-frequency trading for the first time to finding confidence in her career path.\nCan you tell us a bit about your background?\nI studied Computer Science at Babeș-Bolyai University in Romania, where I also did a master’s in Artificial Intelligence. Prior to joining Optiver, I worked as a Full-Stack Software Engineer on a variety of projects, ranging from a car dealership platform to a medical application for the European Union. So I already had some engineering experience, but mostly in more traditional software environments.\nWhy did you want to want to apply for Career Kickstarter, and what were you hoping to get out of the experience?\nI wanted to see what it’s actually like to work in a high-frequency trading firm – to understand the technology, the kinds of problems being solved, and what the culture is like behind it all.\nIn Romania, there isn’t that much awareness about trading firms yet. Until recently, I didn’t really know what they did or if they even hired from my country. But then some people at my university started applying and talking about their experiences, so I became curious and started researching on my own.\nOptiver’s program stood out because it felt serious and well thought out.\nOther programs I found were just one or two days, but this one was a full week, so it felt like something that would really help me grow and learn, not just observe from the sidelines.\nBefore joining, did you have any expectations or worries about working in a male-dominated field?\nIn Romania, computer science is actually quite balanced – my classes were around 50/50, and a lot of my team leads were women. So I’d never experienced the kind of imbalance I’d heard existed in finance.\nI was also a bit nervous that I’d be expected to already know everything. That if I made a mistake, it’d be seen as a bad sign. But that fear completely disappeared after the first day. The trainers created such a comfortable environment where it didn’t matter if you got something wrong – what mattered was thinking out loud, asking questions and learning together. It made me realise that speaking up, even when you’re unsure, is much more valuable than staying quiet.\nThat mindset has really stayed with me, even now in the Academy.\nWas there a particular session in the program that stood out to you?\nYes, the System Design session with Zuotian and Fred. We started from scratch, talking about what an exchange system actually does, and broke it down together. What data comes in? What do we send out? What needs to happen in between?\nIt was all leading up to us building our own version of an exchange in teams, so everything we discussed had a purpose.\nAt one point, I gave a design suggestion, and the trainer smiled and said, “Is that what would work best in a live trading scenario?” That moment clicked. I realised I’d jumped straight to a solution without really understanding the problem. It’s a completely different kind of challenge than what I’m used to, which made me want to explore more.\nWhat I found most interesting was how the technical priorities in trading are so different from those in other industries. In my previous roles, the goal was always high availability, meaning that your system should never crash. But in trading, it’s actually better to restart completely than to risk acting on inconsistent data. That completely changed the way I thought about system design.\nHow did the experience change your view of what tech careers at Optiver are like?\nIt gave me a completely different view. I realised how much potential there is for growth – not just technically, but personally too. Everyone is incredibly talented, but it never felt competitive. People genuinely want you to succeed.\nI never felt like I was being assessed. The trainers gave constant feedback and genuinely cared about our progress, even knowing not everyone would receive an offer. It always felt like they were there to help us improve.\nWe also weren’t isolated in one room for the week. We got to meet engineers across the company, so it felt like we were part of the team.\nNow that you’ve joined as a full-time graduate and are getting onboarded at the Optiver Academy, how do you think the program prepared you for this step?\nThe program gave me a strong foundation in both technical and trading concepts, and now I can really see how everything connects.\nDuring Career Kickstarter, we focused a lot on the exchange side of trading, understanding how orders are processed and how systems communicate. Now, at the Academy, I’m seeing the other side: how the pricing engines are built and how all those components interact. It’s helping me piece together the full picture of how trading technology works in practice.\nWhat I love most is that the sessions are led by people who actually built these systems from the ground up, sometimes 10 or 15 years ago. You get to ask questions directly to the people who designed the tools we’re now learning to use, and that’s pretty special.\nWhat would you tell other women in engineering or computer science who are thinking about applying?\nBe bold from day one. Don’t hold back from asking questions or sharing your ideas, even if you’re unsure. You’ll be surprised how much you can learn when you just speak up and stay curious.\nAnd don’t worry if you don’t have any finance knowledge. I came in with no experience in that area, and the way Optiver explains things makes it feel very intuitive. The trainers guide you through concepts in a way that feels natural, like you’re discovering the logic yourself.\nThe program really does challenge you, but in the best way possible. It pushes you to understand things deeply, not just at a surface level. In my previous roles, there were always parts of the system that stayed a bit of a black box – you’d make assumptions and move on.\nHere, you start from the ground up, understanding how every component works and connects. That kind of depth makes you much more confident in what you’re building.\nIf you could give your past self advice before applying, what would it be?\nI’d tell myself to stop overthinking and just apply. You’ll come out of it feeling more confident, more inspired, and with a much clearer sense of what you want to do next.\nReady to engineer your future?\nOptiver’s Career Kickstarter: Women in Tech program is designed to help you explore what a career in technology within trading really looks like.

Our investment professionals benefit from resources tailored to capitalize on opportunities in international markets.\nOur investment teams take a bottom-up approach to analyzing a company and are experts in their industries. Each sector-focused investment team uses a variety of inputs to develop a deep understanding of a company’s strategy, management team, drivers of performance and cyclical and secular industry trends. Investing with a market-neutral approach, our teams pursue optimal returns regardless of market conditions.\nKey Strategies\nFundamental long/short\nEvent-driven\nEquity capital markets\nSectors\nConsumer\nFinancials\nHealthcare\nIndustrials\nTechnology, Media & Telecom\nContinuous Talent\nDevelopment\nWe recruit people who are tremendously talented and relentlessly curious, and we help them build careers. Coming from a variety of backgrounds, from economics and accounting to engineering, law and medicine, each team member shares an appetite to learn and apply their knowledge to the markets. Every individual is evaluated for character, capability and their drive to succeed.\nFrom their first day, new colleagues are immersed in a comprehensive training program, focusing on leveraging the firm’s proprietary research tools, alternative data and risk management. Everyone has room to grow, regardless of experience. We foster a culture of collaboration and best practice sharing, including panel discussions, coaching from experienced investment professionals and internal and external expert speakers.\nWe believe in the power of the team. Individuals benefit from the collective knowledge within International Equities and the whole of Citadel, allowing us to connect the dots and better forecast markets.\nSet Up for Success\nWe ask our colleagues what they need to be successful, then provide it to them. Backed by the full scale of Citadel, our portfolio managers can build their teams to maximize their contribution to the firm.\nFew can rival our investment in technology, data and people. Investment professionals leverage internal research and analysis as the foundation of their approach. With dedicated data scientists, researchers and traders, our investment process is both rigorous and efficient, helping investment professionals identify and pursue opportunity early.\nWe continuously look for ways to automate and outsource workflows, allowing investment professionals to focus on the highest value tasks. Decades of investment in risk management technology, along with an experienced local quantitative research team, provide differentiated insights into market moves and enable ongoing capital deployment where and when opportunities arise.\nTeam Leadership\nDrew Gillanders\nHead of International Equities\nDrew Gillanders returned to Citadel in June 2023 after previously serving as a healthcare and consumer portfolio manager at the firm from 2019 to 2022.\nDrew has more than 20 years of investment experience across long/short and event-driven strategies in the U.S. and Europe.

We invest via convertible notes, such as SAFEs, or via straight equity subscriptions. On the token side, we do SAFTs, as well as Token Warrants or Token Purchase Agreements. We are committed to remaining flexible in our investment model to fit the needs of our portfolio companies. What stages does Wintermute Venture invest in?Most of our investments focus is on early-stage (pre-seed to Series A) startups, but we also participate in later stage deals. What are Wintermute Venture’s main investment criteria?We focus on category-defining startups with the boldness to redefine entire sectors and industries. We focus on founders who have a strong vision, who are willing to be coached throughout their growth journey.Does an investment mandate a liquidity partnership with Wintermute?In contrast to other trading firms, we don’t force our portfolio companies into a commercial relationship with our trading business. We act and think as independent venture investors and as such, we encourage companies to work with any liquidity provider that meets their needs. What is Wintermute Venture’s usual ticket size?We don’t have a “usual” ticket size. One of our greatest strengths is our flexible mandate, which allows us to adjust our ticket size depending on how much the company is looking to raise. Can Wintermute Venture lead investment rounds?We often lead and co-lead investment rounds; however, given the flexibility of our mandate, we are open to following the terms set by another lead VC.VenturesApply To get funding and build with usContactContactTo reach Wintermute VenturesVentures › PortfolioPortfolioTo view our portfolio companies"

We're researchers, engineers, and builders from a range of disciplines, working to make sure powerful AI goes well for everyone. If you're drawn to hard problems with real stakes, we'd like to meet you.Explore open rolesBuilding AnthropicOur co-founders discuss the origins of Anthropic, the “race to the top” in AI development, and where AI technology will go from here.Principles that guide how we show up for each other and our missionAct for the global goodWe strive to make decisions that maximize positive outcomes for humanity in the long run. This means we’re willing to be very bold in the actions we take to ensure our technology is a robustly positive force for good. We take seriously the task of safely guiding the world through a technological revolution that has the potential to change the course of human history, and are committed to helping make this transition go well.Hold light and shadeAI has the potential to pose unprecedented risks to humanity if things go badly. It also has the potential to create unprecedented benefits for humanity if things go well. We need shade to understand and protect against the potential for bad outcomes. We need light to realize the good outcomes.Be good to our usersAt Anthropic, we define “users” broadly. Users are our customers, policy-makers, Ants, and anyone impacted by the technology we build or the actions we take. We cultivate generosity and kindness in all our interactions—with each other, with our users, and with the world at large. Going above and beyond for each other, our customers, and all of the people affected by our technology is meeting expectations.Ignite a race to the top on safetyAs a safety-first company, we believe that building reliable, trustworthy, and secure systems is our collective responsibility—and the market agrees. We work to inspire a ‘race to the top’ dynamic where AI developers must compete to develop the most safe and secure AI systems. We want to constantly set the industry bar for AI safety and security and drive others to do the same.Do the simple thing that worksWe take an empirical approach to problems and care about the size of our impact and not the sophistication of our methods. This doesn’t mean we throw together haphazard solutions. It means we try to identify the simplest solution and iterate from there. We don’t invent a spaceship if all we need is a bicycle.Be helpful, honest, and harmlessAnthropic is a high-trust, low-ego organization. We communicate kindly and directly, assuming good intentions even in disagreement. We are thoughtful about our actions, avoiding harm and repairing relationships when needed. Everyone contributes, regardless of role. If something urgently needs to be done, the right person to do it is probably you!Put the mission firstAt the end of the day, the mission is what we’re all here for. It gives us a shared purpose and allows us to act swiftly together, rather than being pulled in multiple directions by competing goals. It engenders trust and collaboration and is the final arbiter in our decisions. When it comes to our mission, none of us are bystanders. We each take personal ownership over making our mission successful.01 /07How we support youWe want you to thrive at work and feel confident that you and your family are taken care of. That means comprehensive benefits, competitive compensation, and resources to help you do your best work.Health and wellnessComprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependentsInclusive fertility benefits via Carrot Fertility22 weeks of paid parental leaveFlexible paid time off and absence policiesMental health support for you and your dependentsCompensation and supportCompetitive salary and equity packagesOptional equity donation matching at a 1:1 ratio, up to 25% of your equity grantRetirement plans with competitive matchingLife and income protection plansAdditional benefits$500/month flexible wellness and time saver stipendCommuter benefitsAnnual education stipendHome office stipendsRelocation support for those moving for AnthropicDaily meals and snacks in the officeHow we hireOur interview process is designed to find thoughtful people with diverse expertise. Here’s what to expect.What we are looking forWe care about what you can do, not where you learned to do it. About half our technical staff had no prior ML experience; about half have PhDs, but plenty of brilliant colleagues never went to college. If you’ve done interesting independent research, written a thoughtful blog post, or contributed to open source, put that at the top of your resume.One thing worth knowing: engineers here do lots of research, and researchers do lots of engineering. If you have an engineering background, apply as an engineer—you’ll perform better in the interviews, and you’ll have as much input into Anthropic’s direction as anyone else. All our papers have engineers as authors, often as first author.For non-technical roles, we’re looking for people who bring clarity, judgment, and a genuine interest in the mission. Our policy, operations, and business teams are small and high-impact. You’ll shape how we work, not just execute on a playbook.The interview processAll interviews are conducted over Google Meet, and we can accommodate a variety of timezones.For technical roles, we use live coding tools like Colab and CodeSignal. You can look things up—just be comfortable with basic syntax and standard libraries so it doesn’t eat up your time. We’ll ask about your experience and what motivates you, and you'll have time to ask us about Anthropic.For non-technical roles, interviews are conversational. We want to understand how you think through problems and what draws you to this work.You’ll have time to ask us about Anthropic too. We want this to be a two-way conversation.Your safety matters to usTo protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

We’re happy to give you space to think and finish any other interview processes you’re going through.Do you sponsor visas?Yes. We sponsor visas and green cards, though some operations roles are harder to support. If we make you an offer, we’ll make every effort to get you here.What’s your remote work policy?Most staff are in the Bay Area and come to the office regularly. Some live further away and come in for one week a month. We can also be flexible during a transition period if you’re relocating.Want to help us build the future of safe AI?Explore open roles\n\n========================================\nPAGE: RESEARCH\nURL: https://www.anthropic.com/research\n========================================\n\nResearchOur research teams investigate the safety, inner workings, and societal impacts of AI models – so that artificial intelligence has a positive impact as it becomes increasingly capable.Research teams:AlignmentEconomic ResearchInterpretabilitySocietal ImpactsInterpretabilityThe mission of the Interpretability team is to discover and understand how large language models work internally, as a foundation for AI safety and positive outcomes.AlignmentThe Alignment team works to understand the risks of AI models and develop ways to ensure that future ones remain helpful, honest, and harmless.Societal ImpactsWorking closely with the Anthropic Policy and Safeguards teams, Societal Impacts is a technical research team that explores how AI is used in the real world.Frontier Red TeamThe Frontier Red Team analyzes the implications of frontier AI models for cybersecurity, biosecurity, and autonomous systems.Project Vend: Phase twoPolicyDec 18, 2025In June, we revealed that we’d set up a small shop in our San Francisco office lunchroom, run by an AI shopkeeper. It was part of Project Vend, a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. How has Claude's business been since we last wrote? InterpretabilityOct 29, 2025Signs of introspection in large language modelsCan Claude access and report on its own internal states? This research finds evidence for a limited but functional ability to introspect—a step toward understanding what's actually happening inside these models.InterpretabilityMar 27, 2025Tracing the thoughts of a large language modelCircuit tracing lets us watch Claude think, uncovering a shared conceptual space where reasoning happens before being translated into language—suggesting the model can learn something in one language and apply it in another.AlignmentFeb 3, 2025Constitutional Classifiers: Defending against universal jailbreaksThese classifiers filter the overwhelming majority of jailbreaks while maintaining practical deployment. A prototype withstood over 3,000 hours of red teaming with no universal jailbreak discovered.AlignmentDec 18, 2024Alignment faking in large language modelsThis paper provides the first empirical example of a model engaging in alignment faking without being trained to do so—selectively complying with training objectives while strategically preserving existing preferences.PublicationsSearchDateCategoryTitleJan 29, 2026AlignmentHow AI assistance impacts the formation of coding skillsJan 28, 2026AlignmentDisempowerment patterns in real-world AI usageJan 22, 2026AnnouncementsClaude's new constitutionJan 19, 2026InterpretabilityThe assistant axis: situating and stabilizing the character of large language modelsJan 15, 2026Economic ResearchAnthropic Economic Index: new building blocks for understanding AI useJan 15, 2026Economic ResearchAnthropic Economic Index report: economic primitivesJan 9, 2026AlignmentNext-generation Constitutional Classifiers: More efficient protection against universal jailbreaksDec 19, 2025AlignmentIntroducing Bloom: an open source tool for automated behavioral evaluationsDec 18, 2025PolicyProject Vend: Phase twoDec 4, 2025Societal ImpactsIntroducing Anthropic Interviewer: What 1,250 professionals told us about working with AI See moreJoin the Research teamSee open roles\n\n========================================\nPAGE: JOIN OUR TEAM\nURL: https://www.anthropic.com/careers/jobs\n========================================\n\nBack to CareersJoin our teamAll TeamsAI Public Policy & Societal ImpactsAI Research & EngineeringCommunicationsComputeData Science & AnalyticsEngineering & Design - ProductFinanceLegalMarketing & BrandPeopleProduct Management, Support, & OperationsSafeguards (Trust & Safety) SalesSecuritySoftware Engineering - InfrastructureTechnical Program Management All OfficesBangalore, IndiaBoston, MABritish Columbia, CADublin, IELondon, UKMunich, GermanyNew York City, NYOntario, CAParis, FranceRemote-Friendly US (Travel Required)San Francisco, CASeattle, WASeoul, South KoreaSydney, AustraliaTokyo, JapanWashington, D.C.Zürich, CHTeamRoleLocationAI Public Policy & Societal Impacts9 Open Roles9 Open RolesGeopolitics Analyst, PolicySan Francisco, CA | New York City, NY | Washington, DCApplyManager, National Security PolicyWashington, DCApplyProduct Public Policy Manager, Privacy & Data GovernanceSan Francisco, CAApplyPublic Policy, Events LeadSan Francisco, CA;

It was part of Project Vend, a free-form experiment exploring how well AIs could do on complex, real-world tasks. How has Claude's business been since we last wrote? InterpretabilityOct 29, 2025Signs of introspection in large language modelsCan Claude access and report on its own internal states? This research finds evidence for a limited but functional ability to introspect—a step toward understanding what's actually happening inside these models.InterpretabilityMar 27, 2025Tracing the thoughts of a large language modelCircuit tracing lets us watch Claude think, uncovering a shared conceptual space where reasoning happens before being translated into language—suggesting the model can learn something in one language and apply it in another.AlignmentFeb 3, 2025Constitutional Classifiers: Defending against universal jailbreaksThese classifiers filter the overwhelming majority of jailbreaks while maintaining practical deployment. A prototype withstood over 3,000 hours of red teaming with no universal jailbreak discovered.AlignmentDec 18, 2024Alignment faking in large language modelsThis paper provides the first empirical example of a model engaging in alignment faking without being trained to do so—selectively complying with training objectives while strategically preserving existing preferences.PublicationsSearchDateCategoryTitleJan 29, 2026AlignmentHow AI assistance impacts the formation of coding skillsJan 28, 2026AlignmentDisempowerment patterns in real-world AI usageJan 22, 2026AnnouncementsClaude's new constitutionJan 19, 2026InterpretabilityThe assistant axis: situating and stabilizing the character of large language modelsJan 15, 2026Economic ResearchAnthropic Economic Index: new building blocks for understanding AI useJan 15, 2026Economic ResearchAnthropic Economic Index report: economic primitivesJan 9, 2026AlignmentNext-generation Constitutional Classifiers: More efficient protection against universal jailbreaksDec 19, 2025AlignmentIntroducing Bloom: an open source tool for automated behavioral evaluationsDec 18, 2025PolicyProject Vend: Phase twoDec 4, 2025Societal ImpactsIntroducing Anthropic Interviewer: What 1,250 professionals told us about working with AI See moreJoin the Research teamSee open roles"
